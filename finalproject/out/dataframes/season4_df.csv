85,"season 4 is incredible. ircc, season 5 is where they outpace the books a bit and it becomes apparent george's story was doing most of the heavy lifting for the showrunners.   


\- how did they bungle dorne so badly? they send jamie and bronn on a buddy mission and they fail with hardly any drama.   
\- the forced love interest between grey worm and missandei is one of d&b's greatest crimes against the text.   
\- not show specific but the boltons were known for skinning people alive and everyone just accepted it.",0.0775641025641026,0.4756410256410256

so, for those of you who don\`t know there is a trope created by tv tropes called complete monster (also known as pure evil). they are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. there are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:

1. the character has absolutely no redeeming qualities. even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he/she could still become a complete monster if he/she loses them. even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.
2. the character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. we also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. this means that if a character has more resources (if for example he/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. if a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he/she is a lone serial killer), then he/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. if a character\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he/she can\`t be a complete monster. the character\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a complete monster:

\- the baseline standard - this is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. this means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is really extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).

\- the standards of the work - this means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his/her actions are bad enough to make him/her stand out. this means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like my little pony needs to be compared to other villains from my little pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as warhammer 40000, a song of ice and fire and berserk. similarly, a villain who comes from a work withâ high heinous standard shouldâ  be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not toâ villains that come from my little pony.

\- the resource standard - this means that we should also take into consideration the villain\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as i already mentioned.

\- the system standard - this means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the galactic empire for example)

3) the character\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he/she has either no excuse for his/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his/her personality, it doesn\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\`t try to make you feel sorry for them. in short, this means that the audience is not supposed to feel any sympathy for the character.

4) the character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. this means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed, made of evil or from a race or culture that can\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\`t qualify. however, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the joker).

5) the character is portrayed seriously and is not a comic relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). even if the character is funny he/she can still be a complete monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. if the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\`s shows), then he/she can\`t be a complete monster.

6) the character must make at least one appearance in the story itself. characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearanceâ can\`t qualify. aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen/off-pageâ and are only vaguely described, then he/she can\`t be a complete monster.

7) the audience is not supposed to feel bad for a complete monsterr when something bad happens to him/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the complete monster.

8) the character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than ""bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason"" type of plot. a horror film or book can still contain a complete monster but it needs to have some plot. for this reasons films like human centipede and serbian film don\`t contain complete monsters because they are viewed by tvtropes as plotless exploitationâ even though the villains are extremely repulsive.

9) a character must meet all of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a complete monster.

now, i will copy and paste a list of all the characters that are listed as complete monsters in the series:

* [joffrey baratheon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthronesjoffreybaratheon) is a dyed-in-the-wool sadist who seems to take pleasure only in fear and suffering. at first putting on a [charming face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/bitchinsheepsclothing), his true colors are hinted at when he begins carving up the face of arya stark's lowborn friend for fun, before trying to kill arya herself for hitting him, despite the fact she's the younger sister of his fiancã©e, sansa. after becoming king, however, joffrey really comes into his own as a vicious bastard, ordering ned stark's execution even though it ensures a civil war with the north. viewing sansa as his toy, he frequently has her [humiliated, beaten and threatened with death and rape.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/domesticabuse) among his many cruel acts, joffrey has a bard choose between losing his hands or his tongue, tries to drown ser dontos with wine, orders a crowd of peasants executed because one threw some dung at him, forces one prostitute to beat another, possibly to death, at crossbow point, and eventually shoots ros full of crossbow bolts just to experience what it's like to personally kill someone. the taboo of kin killing means little to joffrey either, as he threatened to [execute his mother](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/matricide) for slapping him, tried to have his uncle tyrion assassinated, and had his bastard siblings (including [children and babies](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/wouldhurtachild)) butchered so no one would notice [how little joffrey resembled his supposed father](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/bastardbastard), robert baratheon. in the end, joffrey was merely a [vicious, idiot king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/royalbrat) who believed [ruling meant everyone was his to torment.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thecaligula)
* [ser gregor clegane](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthroneshouseclegane), the mountain, is [the most feared knight in westeros](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thedreaded) and [works for](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/psychoforhire) tywin lannister and his family. a violent sadist who had once [burned his brother's face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/bigbrotherbully) for playing with one of his toys, gregor is introduced in the hand's tournament where he murders another contender via splintered lance; when loras tyrell manages to unhorse him, gregor slaughters his own horse for failing him and attempts to murder loras. when gregor's own brother interferes, gregor tries to kill him as well. when next seen, gregor is head of the occupying lannister forces at harrenhal where he selects prisoners to be tortured to death by one of his men known as [the tickler](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/torturetechnician). when harrenhal is lost, gregor has every prisoner put to the sword, leaving hundreds of corpses for the next arrivals to find. in season 4, gregor is seen practicing his sword skills by butchering prisoners in wholly one-sided duels before he enters into a trial by combat representing the crown against prince oberyn martell who wishes to force gregor to confess to the murder of oberyn's sister elia and her children. when gregor gets his hands on oberyn, he [shoves his thumbs through the prince's eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/eyescream) before [squeezing his head until it explodes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/yourheadasplode), wanting to hurt the man as much as possible while he roars out his guilt in [killing the children](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/wouldhurtachild) before he raped and murdered elia.
* [craster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/bastardbastard) is a particularly nasty [wildling](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthroneswildlings) who resides beyond the wall, making his living as an ally to the night's watch by providing them with supplies, shelter and info. craster delights in antagonizing them, however, hiding behind the fact he's necessary to them to avoid reprisal. what makes craster sickening is how he rules his self-given kingdom: craster routinely [marries any daughters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/wifehusbandry) he has when they come of age, [beating and raping his many wives and daughter-wives](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/villainousincest). if they bear him sons, craster [sacrifices them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/humansacrifice) by leaving them out for the white walkers. craster threatens violence on those he can't simply cow into submission and relishes the lack of law beyond the wall to simply do whatever he wants, even having the audacity to claim he is a ""godly man"" when criticized.
* [ramsay snow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthronesramsaybolton), the bastard son of lord roose bolton and the most vicious member of house bolton, is a sadist with a knack for torture and [flaying others alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/flayedalive). after capturing winterfell, ramsay proceeded to play [twisted games](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/mindrape) with the captive theon greyjoy, pretending to be an ironborn agent who comes to save theonâkilling his own men to keep up the ruseâand culminating in ramsay bringing theon to the dreadfort and subjecting him to prolonged, hideous torture, including [flaying bits of him](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/fingore) and [castrating](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/cripplingcastration) him. all that remains of theon afterwards is a broken, obedient shell whom ramsay dubs ""reek."" in his spare time, ramsay and his equally psychotic lover [myranda](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/darkmistress) release girls into the woods to hunt them for sport, also using the girls to feed ramsay's savage hounds. when ramsay makes theon negotiate a surrender with other ironborn, ramsay guarantees their safety, [only to have them flayed alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/ilied) and displayed as gruesome trophies. after marrying sansa stark, ramsay rapes her on the wedding night and continues to [sexually and physically abuse her](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/domesticabuse) throughout the rest of the marriage. ramsay cements his rule over his hold by murdering roose and having his hounds eat his infant brother and stepmother. when he finally engages the northern armies, ramsay is [apathetic to the death of his own men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/wehavereserves) and shoots the preteen rickon stark deadâmoments before he reaches jon snow. with few matching his pointless savagery, ramsay snow exemplified every [negative stereotype about bastards](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/bastardbastard) in westeros.
* [lord walder frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/fromnobodytonightmare), head of [house frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthroneshousefrey), is a [smug](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/smugsnake) old man who nevertheless appears to be little more than a doddering but harmless [pervert](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/dirtyoldman) before the true depths of his treachery are made apparent. in alliance with tywin lannister and roose bolton, walder organizes the [red wedding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/weddingsmashers) and [oversees the deaths of robb stark, his pregnant wife talisa, catelyn, and the near-entirety of their bannermen](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/recap/gameofthroness3e9therainsofcastamere) in a full-on massacre whilst nonchalantly drinking from a cup of wineâfor the sake of power and getting back at robb for breaking his wedding vow. walder coldly dismisses the life of his teenage wife once catelyn takes her hostage with the logic of ""i'll find another"" and doesn't so much as blink when her throat is cut in front of him. walder is entirety unrepentant about his betrayal and destructive fallout caused by it, and [cruelly gloats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/evilgloating) about his victory and the new position of power he's snagged for the rest of his role in the series. walder is a coward and a backstabber who considers even age-old traditions like [guest right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/sacredhospitality) irrelevant in the face of personal gain, and is rightfully detested even in the cutthroat world of westeros for his treason.
* [karl tanner](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/axcrazy) is a [night's watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/characters/gameofthronesnightswatch) member who takes the [taboo of oathbreaking](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/theoathbreaker) to extreme measures by instigating a mutiny in craster's keep which claims the lives of lord commander jeor mormont and all of his loyalists. after taking over at craster's keep, karl rules with an iron fist, drinks wine from the skull of the very commander he betrayed, relishes his past as a [psycho for hire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/psychoforhire), and pressures his men to rape and brutalize craster's wives/daughters, who are [too terrified of karl's violent outbursts](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thedreaded) to oppose him. when one of craster's wives steps in with the last-born baby boy, karl's first reaction is to [attempt to kill it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/wouldhurtachild) for not wanting any more mouths to feed. he's only stopped when the wives point out that they leave them as a sacrifice for the white walkers, so he has that done instead. once his men captures bran and his group, karl abuses bran and menaces meera in order to get him to speak, later attempting to gang-rape meera with his men while [forcing her brother to watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/forcedtowatch). when encountered by jon snow, karl shows nothing but pride for his treachery and relishes the time he and his men had as free men, [despite mocking craster for the same lifestyle a while back](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/hypocrite).

the most evil characters according to these criteria are joffrey, gregor, craster, ramsay, walder frey and karl tanner. the other characters are not listed because they don't meet the criteria to be called pure evil.

388,"hereâs mine:

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay

467,"soooo not too long ago, i asked on this very same subreddit this question but for season 4. people really quickly made me realize that there are too much loose ends in s4 for it to be a satisfying ending.

however, this is not the case for s6. granted, it would've been more of an open ending than s8 *shudder* was, but i wonder if it could have worked. 

so for reminder of where the mains plots are at this point :

-samwell arrives at the citadelle

-arya leaves the faceless men and avenges her family 

-bran learns jon's true parentage 

-the starks finally got winterfell back and jon is named king in the north (it's also imply that sansa might not be too happy about that and lf seems more than happy to take advantage of that)

-cersei exploded the vatican with the hs, the tyrell - except olenna and her other ennemies. tommen kills himself and cersei seizes the iron throne

-dany makes tyrion her hand and they sail to westeros with the tyrell and the martell's forces behind them


so, do you think an open ending like this would have worked ? do you think most fans would have been satisfied and individually what would you have think of it ?

(sorry for asking again this similar question, i'm just really thinking hard about got's terrible ending lately and i can't help but wondering that if the show was doomed to fail this spectaculary given who was in charge of it, was there a way to prevent the damage the last two seasons did ?)

[edit] : alright i think it's clear now. game of thrones couldn't have ended at the end of s4 nor at the end of s6, but what about s7- no i'm joking ðð
this is a story that needs a complete ending tying all the storylines into something that makes sense and is faithful to this universe we fell in love with.
