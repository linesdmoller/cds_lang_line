18,"(this is all from the standpoint of someone who didnât spend years watching the show)

i binged the show in less than a month, which was super fun. yeah the destination wasnât very good, but i loved the journey. from a filmmaking standpoint, itâs an incredible show, with some of the best production value iâve seen on tv. and the writing is amazing in seasons 1-6. i love how the show was always one step ahead of me. my favorite scene in the show might be scene where the mountain duels oberyn martell, because itâs an example of how great the writing is condensed into one scene. any other show or movie would have oberyn get his revenge on the people who raped his sister, then killed her along with her children. but nope, this is game of thrones. the way the show throws all the narrative cliches out the window and brilliantly subverts the viewers expectations made me fall in love with the show. itâs shock value, but not just for the sake of shock value. almost everything had a reason and justification for happening. obviously, season 8 lacks this, which is why i donât like it, but it doesnât take away everything great the show has done in my opinion. iâd be lying if i said i wasnât disappointed with the ending, i really am. it wasnât a matter of choices the characters made, but how those choices were developed. every choice made in the end couldâve been pulled off, even danyâs heel turn, but it was just so damn rushed. but the first 6 seasons are a 10/10 (or at least close to it) in my eyes, and even season 7 wasnât awful. they just didnât stick the landing, and i donât believe that ruins everything great the show did.",0.2692948717948717,0.5585256410256411

155,"personally i love all 8 seasons and as a violin player and general lover of orchestral music, scores in movies and tv have a great influence on my enjoyment of said medium. i have no doubt that djawadi's score in the last season is a huge reason as to why i loved it. the score of any form of visual has such an impact and really makes me feel the emotions of what is happening on the screen even if what is happening may not be perfectly executed. for this reason i say season 8 is djawadis best score, and is the one i listen to the most. 

honorable mentions go to season 7 because it is like the rock album of the series with all of themes just on full blast. and season 2 aswell because that is where djawadi has figured out the themes for all houses and starts making the songs part of the characters.",0.4230769230769231,0.5128205128205129

one plot thread i thought was stupid was the wight hunt. although, it was the only way to make dany look good to jon and give the night king a dragon.

just imagine when dany would try to conquer westeros if tommem and margarey were on the throne. she would probably say they were tyrants too, but i guess it would have made her look more crazy then having the show forcing you to think about it.",0.15,0.6166666666666667

sansa not telling jon that vale were coming.

not arming the giant. (what would it take to chop a tree so the giant could wield it?he could swoop the infantry circle..)

jon's extra thicc plot armor. he fucking survived a barrage of arrows, his horse turned into a fucking cheese grater but somehow, he survived. (what was he thinking anyways?)

there is no way those bodies would pile up like that in an open battlefield.

jon's suffocation was a cool scene... if it wasn't 30 minutes long.

an experienced archer such as ramsay not aiming for jon's legs when he has his shield up during their ""1v1"".

ramsay shooting the giant instead of jon. (you may argue that he wanted a proper duel with jon but come on. we all know what ramsay is.he is not much for honor.)

overall it was a ""hero gets beaten then gets saved by someone they didn't expect."" cliche.

it had its moments,first contact with cavalries was an awesome scene and cinematography during the battle was simply stunning yet it reminds me of season 7-8 where action and cool scenes are more important than realism.",0.10714285714285714,0.6142857142857143
264,"i'm in my yearly re-watch and i'm at the point where i'm drudging my way through season 7, and i got back to thinking - how would danerys' conquest have gone if tyrion hadn't started taking stupid pills? here's my thought -   
step 1: upon striking the alliance with dorne and the tyrells, immediately march the dornish army to highgarden to combine their strength. tyrion should know that the lannister army would outmatch the tyrells on their own if cersei went on the offensive.  
step 2: deploy the dothraki, commanded by tyrion, to liberate the riverlands and strike an alliance with edmure tully and the riverlords. then have the dothraki capture and occupy harrenhall so they're positioned on the mainland if they're needed again.  
step 3: sail the greyjoy and unsullied fleets together to the western sea, guarded by danerys and 2 dragons (1 dragon remains with missandei to guard dragonstone), to find and kill euron greyjoy and capture or destroy his fleet. tyrion should so, so, so obviously have known that euron was their biggest military threat.  
step 4: once euron is defeated, send the unsullied to take casterly rock. theon then takes the unsullied ships to retake the iron islands. danerys and yara recover the tyrell treasury and supplies from highgarden and take them back to dragonstone for safe keeping.  
step 5: embark varys on a secret mission to the stormlands to find out what the hell has been going on there since stannis sailed north and if there are any allies to be found. if not, march the tyrell and dornish armies to storm's end to take the castle and stage them for the siege of king's landing.  
step 6: surround king's landing with the dornish and tyrells from the south and east, the tullys from the north, and the greyjoy fleet from the sea. having captured all the top fortresses in the kingdom, there's no one left to stop her.

328,"thank you all who've read any of my thoughts and left any comments. the more interesting stuff is toward the bottom. 
i wrote these thoughts as i watched, when i had a thought worth writing i would jot it down in my notes and now i'm copying and pasting them here with a bit of tune-up of course. 

season 8

i wish we'd gotten to see more of arya using her faces and more of bran doing three eyed raven stuff

grey worm is going to die. characters don't have heart felt moments where they make a promise to a loved one and then live to fulfill it. 

i would've loved to see gren at winterfell fighting the dead
are the gods real? the lord of light and many faces seem to be real but what about the rest?

i would've liked to see more of the dothraki preparing although they didn't change much, just putnoon warmer clothes

the clothing that the unsullied wear would not keep them warm, if got winter is anything like ours they'd be freezing

i noticed no one in the north wears anything to keep their ears or nose warm, a simple hood is the most we've gotten

i wonder if being a targaryen is the reason jon gets along with the dragon or if tits just because he's a gentle man 

how does the night king have so many men that look the same and how do some of them have hair and why doesn't the night king have hair?

i hope the night king can speak, that'll make things a lot more interesting
ghost was alive this whole time? i don't think he made more than three appearances since season 5

the dothraki having their weapons lit up like that was awesome, one of my favorite scenes and then seeing their light charge was equally as cool

i hope ghost doesn't die, if he does it should be by jon's side

how did the red woman survive and is she with the army of the dead? she's very mysterious

ed just died for sam. i liked ed and i had hoped to see him live

they can't win this. the dead gave just gotten over the wall and there are countless more coming

it's a shame cersi's troops aren't at winterfell, i'd like to see the mountain fighting 

holy shit episode 3 was crazy, i thought our favorite characters would die, i didn't write too many thoughts during the end of the episode because i completely forgot about it. arya getting the killing blow was cool but i think it should've been jon

cersi can easily win now. there is 1 dragon and over half of the northern army was killed, i hope arya can take her faces and assassinate her

grey worm didn't die which is a pleasant surprise

tyrion trying to reason with cersi is pointless, she is a monster and she'd kill everyone before she steps down as queen

i have a feeling grey worm will either kill the mountain or be killed by him 

the thing missandei said before she died, i thought that was the word that made the dragon breath fire and if it is why didn't drogon do it? that or she was telling them to burn the city

many innocent people are going to die and cersi sadly won't suffer for it

i've lost more and more faith in daenerys as the shows progressed and i hope she can make a comeback but i think jon is being set up to take her down in a heart breaking way

varys is a smart man so i believe putting his rings in the cup and burning the paper was a message for his little birds. i'm not too sure about the paper being burnt as i think it could've been to throw them off but i definitely believe the rings are significant

daenerys killing the innocent was the turning point for me, she's killing as many people as she can.

the soldiers are killing everyone, why? daenerys just turned the people against her and set up jon to take the throne perfectly

cersi deserved a much worse death, rarely do i think anyone deserves to suffer but she deserves the torture theon received and jamie died with her. he didn't need to die but his love for her killed him

2 of my guesses for who will die were right and four of my theories for how people will die were pretty close if not dead on, i guessed that cersi and oberyns wife would die i just didn't know how or when and the close to dead on guesses were theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. jorah will either disappear or die for daenerys. little finger will die because jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. jamie will die for cersi or with her.
 
if jon and grey worm fought who would win? they're both excellent fighters and i'd love to see the fight although i'd probably be upset about how it ends 

why did daenerys completely destroyed king's landing? it feels out of character for her, yes she changed but she became a tyrant pretty quick

tyrion is going to partly blame himself for jamie's death

arya and jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, jon's still walking up the steps as i type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

jon still supports daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

even if jon kills dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

i thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

i wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more i'm irritated. daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. she's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating jon or she's gone crazy 

why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, i don't have names or references to the moments i'm talking about because i didn't jot then down when they happened as i thought they were isolated events but they're not. the only people i can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are stannis, cersi, and dany. obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. i do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

what will the unsullied and dothraki do now that dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

this small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

robin had a much smaller role then i expected.

i think i should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what i'm thinking

i wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. i also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of jon.

the north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. only making alliances when they need to.

what will happen to the body of dany?

jon is really getting a shitty deal. he potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. he deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. he's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

what would have happened to the free folk had dany not been killed? would she have killed them to let them be?

why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord commander since ed died

if bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? i can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

where will bran rule? 

will kings landing be rebuilt? 

arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

i think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. i'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

how long was the time skip? long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, joffery, daenerys, and now bran. 

why/how is bron still alive? i expected tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

the bickering between the kings table i guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

all of neds children are in a position of power. jon looks to be more commander again, sansa is the queen of the north, bran is the king, and arya has her own ship. i imagine ned would be proud of his children.

it is currently 12:00 am and i've justed finished the show. for me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although i didn't like the out of character actions of daenerys i think it was a fairly good ending. i loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to kit harington and sophie turner. (i just found out that sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career i'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

people still don't know that tyrion didn't kill joffery?

who are the best fighters in got skill wise? this is a discussion i'd like to have with you guys. i say the candidates are arya, brienne, jon, oberyn, bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. i think arya is the best (rivaled by jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series i don't believe she'd win, brienne would have the best chance although i imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. the most dangerous man in got was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was jon. 

now to talk about my favorite characters but first the honorable mentions: sansa, missandei, rob stark, podrick, brienne, the hound, grendy, and shireen.

1. jon snow, he reminds me of captain america. he's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. he trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord commander ever 

2. tyrion lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. his life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and i sympathize with him. hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. he's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. daenerys targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. she's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. i wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that i've finished season 8 i see that dany is a lot worse than i expected. i wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but i can't. she's still a favorite

4. arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. i expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. she might even be the best fighter in got

5. prince oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. he lived and died for his sister plus he hates the lannisters and i love that. sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. samwell tarly, he has a good heart and i feel sorry for him. his father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. he also cured jorah of grayscale

7. tormund, here me out with this one. i know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in got are terrible people. i like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for jon

8. ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. he was a good man, an honorable man and i'll forever enjoy his character

9. jamie lannister, i don't know have much reason here. he's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady olena from what probably would've been torture. he's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. he defended sam, supported jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",0.20607572252309106,0.5351873272925903
336,"it's so great to have a show where each episode is like a tiny movie. i love that there are so many characters, therefore many people to cheer on and many to hate. also - the show can afford to kill important characters, so you can never dismiss the possibility of any twist and turn. glorious 6 seasons.

i can't help but be saddened by season 7 (haven't reached season 8 yet). even binge watching isn't helping. the writing is lazy and lacks imagination, the dialogues are cringey or cliche. everything seems rushed... maybe they did kill off too many characters at that point and didn't have enough material planned for the ones that stayed.",0.2409090909090909,0.6590909090909091
353,"i won't be reading comments until next week when i finish the series in fear of spoilers but i still encourage you to say something. 

this is probably the longest post yet, hopefully season 8 will surpass it

season 7
i like jamie, he deserves to die but i like him at least for now. i wish he would betray cersi and join the starks or the targaryens but i doubt it'll happen. he'll die next to cersi although i wouldn't be surprised if they won. people were outraged at the ending so maybe it's because they won

the lannister soldiers arya meets seem really cool.  but she just said she'll kill the queen so we'll see how that goes. is ed sheeran the first celeb cameo?

jon and daenerys teaming up? hell yeah. i don't know why people always have to bow/bend the knee to one or another and why they can't just be equal allies but jon being under daenerys should work out well. i hope the two of them can kill cersi

that crossbow thing that broke the dragon skull is worrisome. i do not like it at all, i hope varys gets down whispers about it do that they're prepared

i love grey worm and i really hope he doesn't die but i already know it'll happen, every character i cherish are gonna die 

it looks like aray is headed to winterfell, i don't think jon will be there by the time she gets there but sansa might. when will the stark kids reunite? will bran see any of his siblings again?

littlefingers obsession with sansa is gross and strange, i hope he never gets her but again this show loves doing the opposite of what i hope for

i thought arya couldn't die because she's a little girl but i remember babies have died on screen and so did olly so she's isn't free from the chopping block

theon and yara might die in the water. if they do it'll be the beginning of the end for daenerys and her army/plan

now i feel like cersi will win. yara is going to due here along with theon and the dornish women will be killed by cersi

theon really disappointed me, more than he did yara. 

oberyns wife is ignorant and i hate it. she has so much pride and ignorance mixed with her pride makes it even worse. cersi is crazy and heartless and now that she's her prisoner i imagine she'll be tortured, not like theon was. i imagine it'll be mostly psychological rather than physical

jamie is cheeked up just as much if not more than cersi

i know a lot of people will die in this show so here are my predictions. arya, cersi, oberyns wife, tyrion, and yara will die in ways that i don't know. theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. jorah will either disappear or die for daenerys. little finger will die because jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. jamie will die for cersi or with her. tormund will either die for jon or against the night king. grey worm will probably die when attacking the rock. cersi might not die, i wouldn't be surprised if she survived the entire time and ended up winning.

what happened to ghost? we haven't seen him since jon was revived so is he still alive?
sam cured jorah, maybe he'll become the best maester

the tyrells have fallen, dorne are out of reach. daenerys came in with overwhelming force, they could've/would've crushed the lannisters but they're being picked apart. their navy has been destroyed, their dragons are no longer full proof, their support is crippled, and their enemies aren't being hit nearly as hard as they're. 

bran gave aray his dagger, i think she did it because she'll need it in the future, perhaps against a white walker 

the dothraki charging into battle like that was amazing, their scream is awesome

i like bron but i like daenerys and her dragons more, if he dies i'll be sadden but not as much as if the reverse happened

will jon and daenerys marry? she said she needed to marry someone and he's king of the north plus a cool guy so i don't imagine there's a better option plus he gets along with drogon

cersi needs to be assassinated before she gets all of her soilders killed 

i wish jorah would've told jon who cured him, it wouldn't matter much but jon would be proud of sam

jon might lose the support of the people and they'll suffer for it

cersi is pregnant, the witch said that she'll only have 3 children and got are really good at consistency so she'll either die or miscarry

a dragon in the undead army? holy shit. i wonder if the other dragons will kill it, a huge arrow, or if it falls with the night king

jon has another fake out death, not mad about it but i do wish he had more time with his uncle. maybe bran can tell him a thing or two about what happened to him. 

will tyrion betray the queen? 

will sansa betray jon or aray? 

aray has become hella creepy.

is cersi being genuine or was she twisting an arm and trying to get her way?

i hope tyrion doesn't die here trying to convince her different.

little finger is manipulating and feeding into sansas worst thoughts. arya needs to kill him before it gets out of hand

i actually wasn't expecting baelish to die and be revealed as the traitor

i also wasn't expecting cersi to be a cunt and betray the north

cersi is going to kill jamie or get him killed, as i write this gregor just stepped in front of jamie so we'll see what happens, jamie didn't get killed and now i hope he rides north and joins jon

kit harington has some nice butt cheeks

what jon and daenerys just did was incest right? i think the targaryens have been doing it for a long time. this is a mind fuck that i'm not sure i like. i think the maester at castle black said something about ageon which is apparently jon's real name so did he know the truth about jon?

i would be content if the rest of this show was just fighting the dead army

the dead army arrives and the lannisters aren't there, no one but the men in black and the free folk are. so many people are going to die, i knew this would end in mass death and part of me wishes i had never started the show because of that. going into the 8thbseason and my heart will be broken a dozen times over

why is the dragons fire blue? it should still be red/orange right? does that mean the dead army had blue blood if any at all?

i hope tormund doesn't die here at the wall, i hope when he dies it's fighting 

who will kill the night king? will he even lose? people were upset about the ending i know i'll be upset if he wins so it's a plausible theory

cersi is a dumb bitch and i can't wait to see her die. her pride/ignorance will kill countless people, she's one of the best villians and lena headey did a fantastic job playing her",0.05914130256913762,0.47393020782196016

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay

i still can't get over the last season. game of thrones has been my favorite show of all time. despite the final season, i still loved the last seven of them.

i was just wondering, does rewatching the show from the beginning till the end make the last season better? i keep thinking that maybe the reason why it sucked for me was because they made us wait two years before releasing the eight season. i didn't watch the season 7 for the second time before diving into season 8. so basically, everything that happened in the seventh season was kind of a blur while i was watching the eight one.

does that make sense? maybe i just find season 8 to be a bad season only because it didn't feel connected to the seventh season. or is it really a shitty season?

i was just wondering, does rewatching the show from the beginning till the end make the last season better? i keep thinking that maybe the reason why it sucked for me was because they made us wait two years before releasing the eight season. i didn't watch the season 7 for the second time before diving into season 8. so basically, everything that happened in the seventh season was kind of a blur while i was watching the eight one.

does that make sense? maybe i just find season 8 to be a bad season only because it didn't feel connected to the seventh season. or is it really a shitty season?

by the way, which story was better in your opinion: the one in the books or the one in the show? i'm planning to read the books as well once i have free time.",0.15333333333333335,0.5311111111111112

1. season 6 (action packed and actual good writing with insane dialogue and subplots)
2. season 7 (good action w good plots, this was where all main character started interacting with each other so it was really cool to see)-this season is way too hated on, if no one read everyone else's opinions and got influenced i feel like this season would get sm more love
3. season 4 (series finally started to pick up in pace and everything somewhat started connecting, subplots and dialogue were also at a peak, something interesting was constantly happening)
4. season 3 (ok season don't even remember key scenes from here other than insane ending)
5. season 1 and 2 (not the best seasons, quite uninteresting with only 2-3 exceptional episodes per season. was all over the place making new viewers confused. too many subplots happening at once for new viewer which can get irritating)
6. season 5 (average joe season, not much action, little to no advancement in sub plots. stannis literally stayed in north for like 4 episodes doing nothingð­ð­, wildlings coming together with jon snow was lit tho)

so earlier on in the series, when bran asks uncle benji to come with them across the wall and to winterfell, his uncle tells him of spells in place to keep the dead outside the wall, and since he had been partially turned, he was prevented from crossing. then, in season 7 ep 6, when they all fly on the dragon across the wall, they brought the hostage zombie with them. i thought the spells kept the zombies from being able to cross the wall, at least to my knowledge at this point in the series. if something about this is mentioned later on in the series, just tell me, but donât tell me what it is. my only thought was that the spell didnât apply if you fly over the wall, only for those attempting to go through the tunnel, but that seems lame. it would do nothing to prevent the undead from climbing over. either that or this is a continuity error in the show.

#changes

the nk - i would change the night king entirely. instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. this is a major change and makes the nk not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. i would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. he's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. another change i would make to the nk is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#omission

mad queen, dothraki, golden company, and euron - with only 13 episodes left i feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#season 7

the nk gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the shadow tower overlooks (kinda like in harry potter with the dementors. this is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) with the assault of the castle arya, theon, and sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are bran, jon, davos, ed, sam, melisandre, tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

instead of arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

sansa goes to the eyrie with brienne and pod to convince robin to send the entirety of the vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which jon has commandeered. upon his return jon offers up the north to bran but bran refuses. bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows jon is the better leader they need. bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. with the 3er having died prematurely bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. i would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

the nk slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. a few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants. (this would have been a scene with her speaking to jorah while overlooking the civilians of mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would dany then begin her sail to westeros. not to conquer but to save.

#beginning of season 8

with the loss of winterfell jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. with the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

in this scenario arya hasn't killed walder. jon meets up and gathers with arya, blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), sansa, bran, beric, thoros, yara, theon, and the hound.

thoros, beric, and the hound have been protecting the small folk from walder's rule. (instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

the nk continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

the taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting arya. while arya will be the 1 to kill walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving edmure. it'll be some assassin's creed shit. also would have more scenes with walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

the following episodes will mostly focus on dany sailing and arya's infiltration of the twins. before killing walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. this will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive arya. (little tangent i do think in the books walder is holding his body i'll bet money on it.) also bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

with the fall of walder arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. with the surrender of the remaining freys the starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. instead of genociding the remaining freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. in this scenario baelish and robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall i say manipulation he has over the boy. i would also give scenes to robin and royce and show the impact and the positive influence royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

with the twins now fortified with greyjoys, starks, tully's, arryn, and frey the nk descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

while the battle would start heavily in jon's favor the neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. with nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the nk's favor. yara, robin, the blackfish, and sam would die here. yara fighting by theon's side, the blackfish arya's, and robin protecting sansa. in his final moments robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

with the blackfish and arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. in his final time he would attempt to consulate arya by telling her ""i never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

as the dead start coming over the wall dany's forces would sweep in. while there is joyous, confusion and relief with dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. ok now hear me out. it obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(like that scene from lotr where saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) it would be similar to that. the nk is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. he watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with dany's arrival. (and chucking spears like tom brady is just stupid.)

as dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. she's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (this is 1 time i thing slow motion could work perhaps with jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

with her untimely death the nk retreats his forces. again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. the nk is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

with the death of dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to kings landing with dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

upon their mother and brother's death both raegal and viserys fly away and take residence in harrenhall. why harrenhall? idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. that shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. and got 1 season left ain't got time to go to volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. this would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

edit  - having a scene of kinvara trying to talk dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#end of season 8

having lost the twins our heroes head further south. towards king's landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the vale and holding the nk at the bloody gate. this is however decided against as jon knows the bloody gate and vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

sansa argues taking casterly rock and making their final fight there. but as jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. he knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. not only that but if jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

as they make their way to kl it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. varys mentions they're in harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. jon would make his leave at night telling only arya his mission. to attempt to tame these beasts. in this story nobody knows jon is a targareyen. neither bran or sam found out so not even jon knows. this is a huge risk but jon sees this as his only hope.

the following episodes would be jon entering harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. this wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. this could also be the revelation that jon is a targareyen but i think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

while jon tames raegal and viscerys it mirrors scenes of the nk taming drogon. this is not an easy feat for the nk however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. this would at least be 2 episodes. 

you would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. war is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. they knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. only tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. cersei already knows he didn't kill joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. this would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as jaime is gone. tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. she's alone and scared of whatever killed jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. she only agrees to protect tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

with a distant roar our heroes think it to be jon but instead it's the nk. in this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) as drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. with bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. it is too late however. as the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (not just a few bricks.) dead drogon with the nk on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

sansa with bran now inside king's landing finds a safe place to lay him down. bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

greyworm with jorah, beric, thoros, theon still hold the shield wall. as the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants. (this would have been a scene with her speaking to jorah while overlooking the civilians of mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would dany then begin her sail to westeros. not to conquer but to save.

#beginning of season 8

with the loss of winterfell jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. with the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

in this scenario arya hasn't killed walder. jon meets up and gathers with arya, blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), sansa, bran, beric, thoros, yara, theon, and the hound.

thoros, beric, and the hound have been protecting the small folk from walder's rule. (instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

the nk continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

the taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting arya. while arya will be the 1 to kill walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving edmure. it'll be some assassin's creed shit. also would have more scenes with walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

the following episodes will mostly focus on dany sailing and arya's infiltration of the twins. before killing walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. this will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive arya. (little tangent i do think in the books walder is holding his body i'll bet money on it.) also bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

with the fall of walder arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. with the surrender of the remaining freys the starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. instead of genociding the remaining freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. in this scenario baelish and robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall i say manipulation he has over the boy. i would also give scenes to robin and royce and show the impact and the positive influence royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

with the twins now fortified with greyjoys, starks, tully's, arryn, and frey the nk descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

while the battle would start heavily in jon's favor the neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. with nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the nk's favor. yara, robin, the blackfish, and sam would die here. yara fighting by theon's side, the blackfish arya's, and robin protecting sansa. in his final moments robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

with the blackfish and arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. in his final time he would attempt to consulate arya by telling her ""i never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

as the dead start coming over the wall dany's forces would sweep in. while there is joyous, confusion and relief with dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. ok now hear me out. it obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(like that scene from lotr where saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) it would be similar to that. the nk is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. he watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with dany's arrival. (and chucking spears like tom brady is just stupid.)

as dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. she's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (this is 1 time i thing slow motion could work perhaps with jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

with her untimely death the nk retreats his forces. again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. the nk is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

with the death of dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to kings landing with dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

upon their mother and brother's death both raegal and viserys fly away and take residence in harrenhall. why harrenhall? idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. that shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. and got 1 season left ain't got time to go to volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. this would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

edit  - having a scene of kinvara trying to talk dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#end of season 8

having lost the twins our heroes head further south. towards king's landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the vale and holding the nk at the bloody gate. this is however decided against as jon knows the bloody gate and vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

sansa argues taking casterly rock and making their final fight there. but as jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. he knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. not only that but if jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

as they make their way to kl it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. varys mentions they're in harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. jon would make his leave at night telling only arya his mission. to attempt to tame these beasts. in this story nobody knows jon is a targareyen. neither bran or sam found out so not even jon knows. this is a huge risk but jon sees this as his only hope.

the following episodes would be jon entering harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. this wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. this could also be the revelation that jon is a targareyen but i think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

while jon tames raegal and viscerys it mirrors scenes of the nk taming drogon. this is not an easy feat for the nk however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. this would at least be 2 episodes. 

you would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. war is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. they knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. only tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. cersei already knows he didn't kill joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. this would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as jaime is gone. tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. she's alone and scared of whatever killed jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. she only agrees to protect tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

with a distant roar our heroes think it to be jon but instead it's the nk. in this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) as drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. with bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. it is too late however. as the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (not just a few bricks.) dead drogon with the nk on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

sansa with bran now inside king's landing finds a safe place to lay him down. bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

greyworm with jorah, beric, thoros, theon still hold the shield wall. as the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062
680,"i'll try not to alter too much what happened prior to season 7. instead of happening in season 8 the battle for winterfell would happen at the very end of season 7. this not a total play by play, i do not go into a whole lot of detail and this is just how i would've taken the story. you'll notice i do not write much on tyrion, varys, or bealish but it's not because they don't do anything but because i'm only focusing on the biggest set pieces. 

#changes

the nk - i would change the night king entirely. instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. this is a major change and makes the nk not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. i would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. he's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. another change i would make to the nk is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#omission

mad queen, dothraki, golden company, and euron - with only 13 episodes left i feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#season 7

the nk gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the shadow tower overlooks (kinda like in harry potter with the dementors. this is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) with the assault of the castle arya, theon, and sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are bran, jon, davos, ed, sam, melisandre, tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

instead of arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

sansa goes to the eyrie with brienne and pod to convince robin to send the entirety of the vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which jon has commandeered. upon his return jon offers up the north to bran but bran refuses. bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows jon is the better leader they need. bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. with the 3er having died prematurely bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. i would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

the nk slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. a few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants.

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062

i absolutely adored seasons 1-6 with season 5 being my least favorite up until episode 8 of that season where it gets incredible.  i loved daenerys and i loved jon as well as many other characters ofc.  season 7 in my opinion was undoubtedly the best season of the show.  everyone was exactly where they needed to be and all my favorite characters were succeeding.  jon and daenerys seem as though they are meant to be together and their love feels truly natural.  jon befriending the dragons was wonderful.  i do wish that daenerys had a sweet moment with ghost.  that said, the last 30 minutes of the last episode of season 7 really ruin a lot for me.  i hate the dragon dying and becoming undead and i hate the revelation that jon is not a snow or stark and i hate even more that he is related to daenerys.  i think that the first three episodes of season 8 are great with the exception of any discussions about jons heritage.  after that its a shit show and i cant stand daenerys character arc ending up as a villain.  i do not like jon being sent away having just killed the love of his life and i do not like bran ruling.

in my perfect world this is how the show would have ended:
seasons 1-7 go exactly as they were made except for the final episode of season 7 and also except for the early realization that jon is not neds son.  

while daenerys is saving jon from being trapped by the army of dead, instead of her dragon being killed, it is wounded badly and flys away.  

in season 8, while daenerys is discussing her love for jon with sansa, instead of someone interrupting, daenerys confessed that she intended to rule the seven kingdoms with jon by her side.  hence the song of ice and fire.  ice and fire uniting to bring peace to the world.

instead of jorja mormont saving daenerys when she is trapped in the long night, she finds herself completely alone and surrounded.  there is no hope until her wounded dragon finally returns and saves her.  soon after, jon and daenerys both ride dragons with the armies to kings landing and take the throne without causing needless mass destruction.  i dont have an opinion with what happens to cersei but i would want the show to end with jon marrying daenerys.

daenerys becoming a villain almost negates the whole show for me.  i have no interest in ever rewatching it because her journey in becoming a strong and kind leader is pointless now.

795,"i'm about to start watching got for the very first time after hearing all the hype about it for a decade. i own the first book but never got around to reading it so i'm going in as blind as i possibly can after hearing everyone freak out about it for 10 years and inevitably spoiling me along the way. i'm doing this after finally watching breaking bad and better call saul for the first time recently as well, and i loved both of those. i do have a few questions, though.

1. should i watch the last few seasons?

i've heard a lot of people say that season 7 and 8 weren't that good, and that the ending sucked, so im wondering if i should watch. i expect the answer to be that yes, i should, but i should expect to be disappointed.

2. how bad/good are the last few seasons?

3. if i don't watch the last few season is there somewhere i should stop?

4. i've heard season 5 is the first season that starts to diverge from the books a bit. is that true?",0.05108695652173914,0.4746376811594203

1282,"sorry to say, but i'm on the complete opposite end, yes it'a rushed but i also hate the choices that the story made to get the characters to be where they were to tie up the story. to me everything had that ""expectation subversion"" clichã© that's been so popular in media recently (more on that later).

i'll always hate his decision to just up and return to cersei, jaime getting with brienne was stupid as the show made it seem like that was the only thing he was trying to redeem about himself. the show depicted jaime trying to regain his own honor that's why he fought so hard to save myrcella, why he went north to fight with the starks. and then within one episode he just abandoned all that with the stupid fucking comment about not caring about the innocents which completely threw his character out the window. the thing about jaime from the very beginning of the show was that he cared about the innocents. that's why he killed the mad king. most people make a strawmen about his only reason for leaving cersei was brienne which is hella stupid as he is a much for developed and complex character. not some stupid teenager who regret having sex so he went back to his ex as the show depicts.

bran is the ultimate combination of that ya clichã© expectation subversion. it throws away everything about worldbuilding, ""power is where people believe it resides"" and so the peasants are now going to follow a heretical, northern crippled boy who can't have children? there'd be riots within weeks! even if he dies of old age there'd be a war of succession and the whole cycle of conquest goes on. also his ""why else do you think i'm here"" shows how terrible of a person he is, he knew the events would unfold out that way (as unrealistic as all the events are) and helped no one just so he could become king, hodor didn't die for a benevolent cause, he died because the selfish cripple boy who hated life every since being crippled can get revenge to manipulate his way to become king. also the fact that a stark ending up as king at all is very much a young adult clichã© (oh look my favorite house now rules all of westeros!)

daenerys is very complicated especially in the which of how she did it. whereas all the terrible things she had done before were to her enemies, those she perceived as such (also mirri daz wasn't fully innocent, but she killed drogo out of vengeance so it's muddy ground i won't fight on) the fact that she did it all after they all surrendered and there were no more ballistas is what's stupid where she just stupidly wanted to keep burning innocents, which is such a stupid way to turn her into the full antagonist.

the stupid thing about the night king is that for some reason the writers didn't incorporate the white walkers into the war for the throne. the north deals with the invasion almost completely on their own with the help from daenerys. they don't broker any alliances to help, they don't trade for food and resources with any of the other kingdoms they just fight and win. which was stupid as hell. they have no lasting effect in the story after they are gone and the fact that the north lost so many soldiers doesn't change the battle for king's landing at all. none of the questions about the others are answered either, they are all just thrown out of the window. not to mention azor ahai got completely trashed. and the fact that the whole war is won because of some slight of hand is the biggest bs in the season.

rather than tying in all these overlaying plots, the writers made half assed conclusions to each one and smashed them together. also, wasn't 'revenge has consequences' been a big thing in the show? why is it okay when arya does it? because she's a super assassin? (also her sex scene with gendry was mega young adult fanservice)

the story had a potential for an excellent ending, even at the end of season 7 and the ball was dropped hard. there's a reason so many people wrote re-writes and fix its, because there are so many better ways for the story to have gone then it actually did.",-0.08862612612612618,0.5987612612612611

1624,"many of the usual complaints. it felt rushed and many characters started acting in ways that felt forced and unnatural. i hated the anticlimax that was the long night, and how neatly it just tied off that entire side of the show. i hated how painfully obvious the plot armor was in that episode, where you can see named characters get swarmed by wights and then it just cuts away and theyâre fine. i also hated how hard it is to see the vast majority of that battle.

i hated that they undid seven seasons worth of character development for jaime. he was one of my favorite characters, and it felt like they kinda ruined him. i hate how much they dumbed down the most intelligent characters. i hate that dany canât see a fleet sailing in front of her. i felt like every enjoyable moment from the final season still felt contrived and as there to get the plot where they wanted. i didnât mind dannyâs rampage but i donât feel like they did the work to get her to that state of mind.

âbran has the best storyâ feels almost like a direct insult to fans. he does not. i hate how they handled his apparent omniscience. i hate that the new prince of dorne doesnât also seek independence. i hate that jonâs parentage ultimately means very little to the plot. i hate euronâs eye-liner. i stopped caring about the starks, i actually stopped caring about most of the characters. i hate how utterly useless harry strickland was.

i love some moments. parts of the long night are impressive, brienne getting knighted, any acknowledgement of nymeria. danyâs rampage is very difficult to watch in the best possible way, and the aftermath of that slaughter is striking. but the negatives so outweighed the positives that it didnât matter much.

edit: i see many people trotting out the idea that the only people upset were those that got their hopes up for certain outcomes. this was not a matter of expectations for me. i truly didnât have a desired outcome for who lives, who dies and who sits on the throne. by the middle of season 7 iâd learned not to expect for characters to act rationally or for everything to make sense and i went into 8 only hoping for a satisfying resolution, whatever form it took. instead i got bran the broken.",-0.017702840089203722,0.6069369014823559
