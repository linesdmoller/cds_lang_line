18,"(this is all from the standpoint of someone who didnât spend years watching the show)

i binged the show in less than a month, which was super fun. yeah the destination wasnât very good, but i loved the journey. from a filmmaking standpoint, itâs an incredible show, with some of the best production value iâve seen on tv. and the writing is amazing in seasons 1-6. i love how the show was always one step ahead of me. my favorite scene in the show might be scene where the mountain duels oberyn martell, because itâs an example of how great the writing is condensed into one scene. any other show or movie would have oberyn get his revenge on the people who raped his sister, then killed her along with her children. but nope, this is game of thrones. the way the show throws all the narrative cliches out the window and brilliantly subverts the viewers expectations made me fall in love with the show. itâs shock value, but not just for the sake of shock value. almost everything had a reason and justification for happening. obviously, season 8 lacks this, which is why i donât like it, but it doesnât take away everything great the show has done in my opinion. iâd be lying if i said i wasnât disappointed with the ending, i really am. it wasnât a matter of choices the characters made, but how those choices were developed. every choice made in the end couldâve been pulled off, even danyâs heel turn, but it was just so damn rushed. but the first 6 seasons are a 10/10 (or at least close to it) in my eyes, and even season 7 wasnât awful. they just didnât stick the landing, and i donât believe that ruins everything great the show did.",0.2692948717948717,0.5585256410256411

game of thrones is one of my favorite series, but season 8 as a whole was.. not good. so completely rushed and so many nonsensical moments. as a very big fan, it was really sad to witness. the worst thing about the final season however, is not that it was bad in itself, but that it retroactively makes the whole show worse. before season 8 came out, i was planning on rewatching the entire series from start to finish this summer vacation, but now i just.. don't have the desire to do so anymore. season 8 makes so, so many plotlines entirely useless.

* the white walkers. this plotline is definitely the one that suffered the most. introduced in the prologue to the entire show, and always hyped up to be the supernatural main threat, they were just laughably easy defeated. how can you still be invested in this plotline, when you know the white walkers will all die without bringing about the mythical 'long night', without even properly getting into westeros?
* jon's targaryen heritage.. i'm not saying he should have ended up as the king in the end, but him being a targaryen should have had some impact, aside from turning daenerys mad. how can you still get goosebumps during the 'cut from baby jon to grown up jon' in the 'winds of winter', knowing his targaryen heritage and general arc will lead to nothing? or his epic stare-down with the night king in hardome, which also lead to absolutely nothing..
* the endings for jaime, daenerys, bran, etc.. will also lessen the impact of their storylines. is jaime's redemption storyline going to be as good during a rewatch, knowing he will just end up with cersei in the end and die with her? is watching daenerys trying to be a good ruler in mereen for 3 seasons going to be interesting again, knowing she will die as a cartoon villain after destroying king's landing? and what even is the point of bran's storyline, if you know he will end up doing literally nothing (and being proclaimed king doesn't really count, because that has never even once been foreshadowed).

there are many more examples, but these are to my mind the biggest ones. and i'm really not bashing on the show, i love this series so much. but i can't shake the feeling that season 8 retroactively ruined a lot of the show.. i will certainly rewatch it again sometime in the future, but i fear it will never be the same again, and not in a good way..",0.07968073593073594,0.48639610389610405

d&d spent two years working on season 8. how could it be rushed, and that they didn't care? 

the show was wrapping up with dany's conquest, and white walkers conquest. what more of the story could be told? 

if you meant by fast paced. then yes it was. the show was wrapping up. just venting.",9.25185853854297e-18,0.26666666666666666
141,"i'll focus this on changing only season 8, honestly mainly the second half of season 8 and the long night battle. i liked the first two episodes. i feel they really bring back a lot of what made me fall in love with the show in the first place.â  even the battle, for the most part, was great. i would have removed some of the plot armor from some of the characters though. especially with the blunder in the crypts of winterfell. my biggest change to that episode, that changes the whole rest of the show, is that they lose that battle. 

bran: he could have been so important and intriguing. the show already has shown that bran can manipulate the past. in one of the three eyed raven scenes in season 6 or 7, bran sees the true events of the tower of joy.â  for a moment, bran calls out to his young father. young ned hears bran and reacts, proving bran can influence the past.â  i wanted the show to dive deeper into this. it almost seems like they were going to go down this path, but something changed by the end of season 7.â  bran constantly got visions of the mad king in the throne room, cursing ""burn them all.""â  what if bran went back to the past and corrupted the mad king. whispering of the cold death that marches in the north. trying to get the mad king to deal with the white walkers,â  that way, they're already dead in the future.â  but the whispers just drive him mad, the true reason for his madness. bran failed. now the king is insane and there's nothing he can do to stop him burn his grandfather and uncle alive. burn them all. bran meant the white walkers.â  he meant the dead. the mad king took that to mean everyone.â  determined, he goes deeper into the past to find some other way to stop it.â  he goes back further and further, each time failing, each time making the past happen as it has.â  until he's as back as far as he can go. he's at the creation of the white walkers by that tree with the children of the forest. they sense him. use some old magic to force bran into the man they have tied to the tree. the children turn then turn the man into the night king.â  it's mission set by the children of the forest to beat back mankind.â  so thats what he does for thousands of years. until eventually,â  the night king comes across bran for the first time. they touch. something awakens in the night king. it's what's left of bran. it's calling out for one last attempt to end this. to end it all before it begins. all he needs to do is kill bran before he travels back to be turned into the night king. that becomes his new motivation. now, i should mention that all this time travel influencing stuff is happen from the time bran gets to winterfell. you know, when he's pretty much useless sitting there in the godswood? well, this gives him something to do. until the battle. his last ditch effort is on that night. thats the night he goes back as far as he can to see the night king get created. that's the night he becomes the night king. remember when bran caused hodor to hodor and that daisy chained the rest of bran's life to happen? we learned there that bran can't change the past, he can only complete his roll to allow the past to happen.â  so that's what he did here.â  once bran travels back to the past for the final time, the night king will have just entered the godswood. 

the long night:â  like i said earlier,â  some of this plot armor has to go.â  in the godswood, as the night king is approaching bran, an epic battle ensues with theon, arya, beric, and gendry against the white walkers. one by one, they're getting mowed down. first beric, then gendry. they take out 2 white walkers before they die, but its not enough. it's arya and theon backed up against bran. theon tells arya to run before being cut down. she makes her way to the tree line and looks back in time to see the night king plunge his sword into the warged bran.â  she escapes the godswood and sneaks around the overrun castle, looking for survivors.â  she finds the hound, brianne and tormond, fighting in the courtyard. she tells them we've lost, we need to run. they fight there way to the crypt. arya knows a secret way out of the castle through there. that's where they find sansa, tyrion and davos. gilly and messandei died in the crypt. the rest make their way out of the city and into the dark winter woods. dany and drogon helped jon escape the wight dragon and flew away. that's all that gets away. everyone else dies.â  the night king wins. now, with that last bit of bran stark resolved, the night king continues its original intended goal, beat back humanity. that night, the army of the dead begins its march south.â  

cercei: in my version, she would get what she deserves.â  winter would come for kings landing.â  but the night king as a different tactic. he surrounds the city with a mile of undead and waits.â  he waits and waits and waits.â  after all, he brings the storm. and a city of a million people can only last so long without provisions. people start dying by the thousands.â  until the only ones left are the rich and their guard. at least what's left after the uprisings. months go by, and cercei is about ready to have her child. her water breaks. there's only one wet nurseâ  left to help her from the throne room to the nursery.â  on her way down, her foot slips on an icy step. the nurse runs for a maester. at the bottom of the staircase, bleeding, cercei lies screaming, for jaimie, for her baby.â  the maester and the wet nurse manage to get cercei to the nursery, she's still screaming in pain, bleeding profusely. she looks down at her wriggling stomach in horror. she can only scream and claw at the ground as she watches her belly torn open from the inside. and what emerges, ironically looks like what cercei imagined tyrion looked like when he killed their mother. except this creature was partially rotted, and glowing a blue eye.â  that's how i would have liked cercei to meet her end. 

so tldr:
bran made the mad king mad.
bran's the night king on accident. 
night king wins at winterfell and kills almost everyone except like 10 people. 
cercei gets eaten by her undead unborn monster baby.

the score is westeros:0, night king:2

148,"hi all! i recently finished writing my own six episode season 8. it was purely for fun and to spend time in the world of got; i'm a huge fan (my left arm is covered in tattoos of house sigils) but like a lot of people i was really disappointed (to put it mildly!) with the final season we got. i like to think my scripts put right a lot of the major issues, but also take things in interesting and surprising directions. very few of the characters end up where they did in the show proper.

i'm currently working on the idea of recording the scripts as a radio play and putting them online as a podcast. 

long story, short, i'd love to hear from anybody that might have an interest in providing one or potentially multiple character voices. if so, please do let me know you age/sex/accent etc and if there's anyone in particular you think you'd be a good fit for. *just to be totally clear, this is just a bit of fun (hopefully) between fans, so there's no remuneration or professional credits involved.* if there is interest, i can move forward with the logistics of recording/editing etc, and if there's not, well, i'll be happy to just go back to writing my robert's rebellion prequel series (season 1 available on reddit, if anyone's interested or wants to get a sense of my writing before expressing interest in the radio play of season 8).

my questions are. do you see the same happening with got?:

* if you loved the ending (final few seasons). what did you like about it?.
* do you think the final few seasons get unfairly criticized, if so, why?.
* is there a character in particular that you loved their arc? (which get's criticized).

so after the credits the black screen fades into a sheep running up a rocky incline. it stops every now and then to munch on grass, but immediately runs off when it's shepard gets close (,who is revealed when the sheep moves a second time). the camera shows a wide shot of the sheep running to the top of this cliff and into what looks like a cave. the shepard, who's clothes are ragged and old, hesitantly enters the cave as he wouldn't be able to afford another if he lost her. he creeps through the dark cavern and gets scared at the bellowing sound of a growl coming from around the corner. as scared as he was, he made his way around the corner to see a most terrifying sight: a giant living, breathing dragon. larger than even the building his family calls home, the massive black creature raises it's massive head and looks directly at the man. despite his terror, he is unable to leave so he observes his surroundings. nestled on drogon's body is the skeleton of a small woman, her platinum hair still laying atop it's skull. a bit further from the selection is a small pile of stones, all shaped the exact same: like a large scaly egg. strangely, the dragon didn't incinerate him and turn him into the blackened charred corpses like the ones paying around him.

why i loved her theory was because not only did it show drogon still loved dany, but it showed the dragons were not extinct/ going extinct when drogon died. on top of that, it almost comes from circle from thousands of years ago when the valaryians, who were all a simple shepard community, first discovered dragons and their eggs and went on to conquer the known world/ build the most advanced city ever in existence. perhaps this shepard was actually a decendant from a valaryian and is now about to lead to the development of the here generation's dragon riders.

it's just a theory and probably not was m what grrm planned but for me, that would've saved the series :) let me know what you think",0.04502164502164501,0.5189935064935066
328,"thank you all who've read any of my thoughts and left any comments. the more interesting stuff is toward the bottom. 
i wrote these thoughts as i watched, when i had a thought worth writing i would jot it down in my notes and now i'm copying and pasting them here with a bit of tune-up of course. 

season 8

i wish we'd gotten to see more of arya using her faces and more of bran doing three eyed raven stuff

grey worm is going to die. characters don't have heart felt moments where they make a promise to a loved one and then live to fulfill it. 

i would've loved to see gren at winterfell fighting the dead
are the gods real? the lord of light and many faces seem to be real but what about the rest?

i would've liked to see more of the dothraki preparing although they didn't change much, just putnoon warmer clothes

the clothing that the unsullied wear would not keep them warm, if got winter is anything like ours they'd be freezing

i noticed no one in the north wears anything to keep their ears or nose warm, a simple hood is the most we've gotten

i wonder if being a targaryen is the reason jon gets along with the dragon or if tits just because he's a gentle man 

how does the night king have so many men that look the same and how do some of them have hair and why doesn't the night king have hair?

i hope the night king can speak, that'll make things a lot more interesting
ghost was alive this whole time? i don't think he made more than three appearances since season 5

the dothraki having their weapons lit up like that was awesome, one of my favorite scenes and then seeing their light charge was equally as cool

i hope ghost doesn't die, if he does it should be by jon's side

how did the red woman survive and is she with the army of the dead? she's very mysterious

ed just died for sam. i liked ed and i had hoped to see him live

they can't win this. the dead gave just gotten over the wall and there are countless more coming

it's a shame cersi's troops aren't at winterfell, i'd like to see the mountain fighting 

holy shit episode 3 was crazy, i thought our favorite characters would die, i didn't write too many thoughts during the end of the episode because i completely forgot about it. arya getting the killing blow was cool but i think it should've been jon

cersi can easily win now. there is 1 dragon and over half of the northern army was killed, i hope arya can take her faces and assassinate her

grey worm didn't die which is a pleasant surprise

tyrion trying to reason with cersi is pointless, she is a monster and she'd kill everyone before she steps down as queen

i have a feeling grey worm will either kill the mountain or be killed by him 

the thing missandei said before she died, i thought that was the word that made the dragon breath fire and if it is why didn't drogon do it? that or she was telling them to burn the city

many innocent people are going to die and cersi sadly won't suffer for it

i've lost more and more faith in daenerys as the shows progressed and i hope she can make a comeback but i think jon is being set up to take her down in a heart breaking way

varys is a smart man so i believe putting his rings in the cup and burning the paper was a message for his little birds. i'm not too sure about the paper being burnt as i think it could've been to throw them off but i definitely believe the rings are significant

daenerys killing the innocent was the turning point for me, she's killing as many people as she can.

the soldiers are killing everyone, why? daenerys just turned the people against her and set up jon to take the throne perfectly

cersi deserved a much worse death, rarely do i think anyone deserves to suffer but she deserves the torture theon received and jamie died with her. he didn't need to die but his love for her killed him

2 of my guesses for who will die were right and four of my theories for how people will die were pretty close if not dead on, i guessed that cersi and oberyns wife would die i just didn't know how or when and the close to dead on guesses were theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. jorah will either disappear or die for daenerys. little finger will die because jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. jamie will die for cersi or with her.
 
if jon and grey worm fought who would win? they're both excellent fighters and i'd love to see the fight although i'd probably be upset about how it ends 

why did daenerys completely destroyed king's landing? it feels out of character for her, yes she changed but she became a tyrant pretty quick

tyrion is going to partly blame himself for jamie's death

arya and jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, jon's still walking up the steps as i type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

jon still supports daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

even if jon kills dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

i thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

i wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more i'm irritated. daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. she's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating jon or she's gone crazy 

why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, i don't have names or references to the moments i'm talking about because i didn't jot then down when they happened as i thought they were isolated events but they're not. the only people i can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are stannis, cersi, and dany. obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. i do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

what will the unsullied and dothraki do now that dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

this small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

robin had a much smaller role then i expected.

i think i should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what i'm thinking

i wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. i also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of jon.

the north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. only making alliances when they need to.

what will happen to the body of dany?

jon is really getting a shitty deal. he potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. he deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. he's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

what would have happened to the free folk had dany not been killed? would she have killed them to let them be?

why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord commander since ed died

if bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? i can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

where will bran rule? 

will kings landing be rebuilt? 

arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

i think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. i'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

how long was the time skip? long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, joffery, daenerys, and now bran. 

why/how is bron still alive? i expected tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

the bickering between the kings table i guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

all of neds children are in a position of power. jon looks to be more commander again, sansa is the queen of the north, bran is the king, and arya has her own ship. i imagine ned would be proud of his children.

it is currently 12:00 am and i've justed finished the show. for me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although i didn't like the out of character actions of daenerys i think it was a fairly good ending. i loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to kit harington and sophie turner. (i just found out that sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career i'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

people still don't know that tyrion didn't kill joffery?

who are the best fighters in got skill wise? this is a discussion i'd like to have with you guys. i say the candidates are arya, brienne, jon, oberyn, bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. i think arya is the best (rivaled by jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series i don't believe she'd win, brienne would have the best chance although i imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. the most dangerous man in got was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was jon. 

now to talk about my favorite characters but first the honorable mentions: sansa, missandei, rob stark, podrick, brienne, the hound, grendy, and shireen.

1. jon snow, he reminds me of captain america. he's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. he trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord commander ever 

2. tyrion lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. his life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and i sympathize with him. hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. he's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. daenerys targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. she's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. i wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that i've finished season 8 i see that dany is a lot worse than i expected. i wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but i can't. she's still a favorite

4. arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. i expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. she might even be the best fighter in got

5. prince oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. he lived and died for his sister plus he hates the lannisters and i love that. sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. samwell tarly, he has a good heart and i feel sorry for him. his father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. he also cured jorah of grayscale

7. tormund, here me out with this one. i know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in got are terrible people. i like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for jon

8. ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. he was a good man, an honorable man and i'll forever enjoy his character

9. jamie lannister, i don't know have much reason here. he's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady olena from what probably would've been torture. he's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. he defended sam, supported jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",0.20607572252309106,0.5351873272925903

tyrion is going to partly blame himself for jamie's death

arya and jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, jon's still walking up the steps as i type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

jon still supports daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

even if jon kills dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

i thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

i wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more i'm irritated. daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. she's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating jon or she's gone crazy 

why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, i don't have names or references to the moments i'm talking about because i didn't jot then down when they happened as i thought they were isolated events but they're not. the only people i can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are stannis, cersi, and dany. obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. i do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

what will the unsullied and dothraki do now that dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

this small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

robin had a much smaller role then i expected.

i think i should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what i'm thinking

i wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. i also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of jon.

the north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. only making alliances when they need to.

what will happen to the body of dany?

jon is really getting a shitty deal. he potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. he deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. he's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

what would have happened to the free folk had dany not been killed? would she have killed them to let them be?

why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord commander since ed died

if bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? i can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

where will bran rule? 

will kings landing be rebuilt? 

arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

i think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. i'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

how long was the time skip? long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, joffery, daenerys, and now bran. 

why/how is bron still alive? i expected tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

the bickering between the kings table i guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

all of neds children are in a position of power. jon looks to be more commander again, sansa is the queen of the north, bran is the king, and arya has her own ship. i imagine ned would be proud of his children.

it is currently 12:00 am and i've justed finished the show. for me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although i didn't like the out of character actions of daenerys i think it was a fairly good ending. i loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to kit harington and sophie turner. (i just found out that sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career i'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

people still don't know that tyrion didn't kill joffery?

who are the best fighters in got skill wise? this is a discussion i'd like to have with you guys. i say the candidates are arya, brienne, jon, oberyn, bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. i think arya is the best (rivaled by jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series i don't believe she'd win, brienne would have the best chance although i imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. the most dangerous man in got was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was jon. 

now to talk about my favorite characters but first the honorable mentions: sansa, missandei, rob stark, podrick, brienne, the hound, grendy, and shireen.

1. jon snow, he reminds me of captain america. he's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. he trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord commander ever 

2. tyrion lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. his life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and i sympathize with him. hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. he's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. daenerys targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. she's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. i wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that i've finished season 8 i see that dany is a lot worse than i expected. i wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but i can't. she's still a favorite

4. arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. i expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. she might even be the best fighter in got

5. prince oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. he lived and died for his sister plus he hates the lannisters and i love that. sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. samwell tarly, he has a good heart and i feel sorry for him. his father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. he also cured jorah of grayscale

7. tormund, here me out with this one. i know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in got are terrible people. i like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for jon

8. ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. he was a good man, an honorable man and i'll forever enjoy his character

9. jamie lannister, i don't know have much reason here. he's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady olena from what probably would've been torture. he's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. he defended sam, supported jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",0.20607572252309106,0.5351873272925903
329,"i started reading the books after the season 8 disappointment and i'm glad i did. the world is bigger and more interesting. i am almost done with the first book. just been wondering lately, will arya be the one to kill night king in the books as well? please don't spoil it if its foreshadowed in the coming books. but based on what the show did, you think it'll be same in the books?",0.10624999999999998,0.4947916666666667

i can't help but be saddened by season 7 (haven't reached season 8 yet). even binge watching isn't helping. the writing is lazy and lacks imagination, the dialogues are cringey or cliche. everything seems rushed... maybe they did kill off too many characters at that point and didn't have enough material planned for the ones that stayed.",0.2409090909090909,0.6590909090909091
353,"i won't be reading comments until next week when i finish the series in fear of spoilers but i still encourage you to say something. 

this is probably the longest post yet, hopefully season 8 will surpass it

season 7
i like jamie, he deserves to die but i like him at least for now. i wish he would betray cersi and join the starks or the targaryens but i doubt it'll happen. he'll die next to cersi although i wouldn't be surprised if they won. people were outraged at the ending so maybe it's because they won

the lannister soldiers arya meets seem really cool.  but she just said she'll kill the queen so we'll see how that goes. is ed sheeran the first celeb cameo?

jon and daenerys teaming up? hell yeah. i don't know why people always have to bow/bend the knee to one or another and why they can't just be equal allies but jon being under daenerys should work out well. i hope the two of them can kill cersi

that crossbow thing that broke the dragon skull is worrisome. i do not like it at all, i hope varys gets down whispers about it do that they're prepared

i love grey worm and i really hope he doesn't die but i already know it'll happen, every character i cherish are gonna die 

it looks like aray is headed to winterfell, i don't think jon will be there by the time she gets there but sansa might. when will the stark kids reunite? will bran see any of his siblings again?

littlefingers obsession with sansa is gross and strange, i hope he never gets her but again this show loves doing the opposite of what i hope for

i thought arya couldn't die because she's a little girl but i remember babies have died on screen and so did olly so she's isn't free from the chopping block

theon and yara might die in the water. if they do it'll be the beginning of the end for daenerys and her army/plan

now i feel like cersi will win. yara is going to due here along with theon and the dornish women will be killed by cersi

theon really disappointed me, more than he did yara. 

oberyns wife is ignorant and i hate it. she has so much pride and ignorance mixed with her pride makes it even worse. cersi is crazy and heartless and now that she's her prisoner i imagine she'll be tortured, not like theon was. i imagine it'll be mostly psychological rather than physical

jamie is cheeked up just as much if not more than cersi

i know a lot of people will die in this show so here are my predictions. arya, cersi, oberyns wife, tyrion, and yara will die in ways that i don't know. theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. jorah will either disappear or die for daenerys. little finger will die because jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. jamie will die for cersi or with her. tormund will either die for jon or against the night king. grey worm will probably die when attacking the rock. cersi might not die, i wouldn't be surprised if she survived the entire time and ended up winning.

what happened to ghost? we haven't seen him since jon was revived so is he still alive?
sam cured jorah, maybe he'll become the best maester

the tyrells have fallen, dorne are out of reach. daenerys came in with overwhelming force, they could've/would've crushed the lannisters but they're being picked apart. their navy has been destroyed, their dragons are no longer full proof, their support is crippled, and their enemies aren't being hit nearly as hard as they're. 

bran gave aray his dagger, i think she did it because she'll need it in the future, perhaps against a white walker 

the dothraki charging into battle like that was amazing, their scream is awesome

i like bron but i like daenerys and her dragons more, if he dies i'll be sadden but not as much as if the reverse happened

will jon and daenerys marry? she said she needed to marry someone and he's king of the north plus a cool guy so i don't imagine there's a better option plus he gets along with drogon

cersi needs to be assassinated before she gets all of her soilders killed 

i wish jorah would've told jon who cured him, it wouldn't matter much but jon would be proud of sam

jon might lose the support of the people and they'll suffer for it

cersi is pregnant, the witch said that she'll only have 3 children and got are really good at consistency so she'll either die or miscarry

a dragon in the undead army? holy shit. i wonder if the other dragons will kill it, a huge arrow, or if it falls with the night king

jon has another fake out death, not mad about it but i do wish he had more time with his uncle. maybe bran can tell him a thing or two about what happened to him. 

will tyrion betray the queen? 

will sansa betray jon or aray? 

aray has become hella creepy.

is cersi being genuine or was she twisting an arm and trying to get her way?

i hope tyrion doesn't die here trying to convince her different.

little finger is manipulating and feeding into sansas worst thoughts. arya needs to kill him before it gets out of hand

i actually wasn't expecting baelish to die and be revealed as the traitor

i also wasn't expecting cersi to be a cunt and betray the north

cersi is going to kill jamie or get him killed, as i write this gregor just stepped in front of jamie so we'll see what happens, jamie didn't get killed and now i hope he rides north and joins jon

kit harington has some nice butt cheeks

what jon and daenerys just did was incest right? i think the targaryens have been doing it for a long time. this is a mind fuck that i'm not sure i like. i think the maester at castle black said something about ageon which is apparently jon's real name so did he know the truth about jon?

i would be content if the rest of this show was just fighting the dead army

the dead army arrives and the lannisters aren't there, no one but the men in black and the free folk are. so many people are going to die, i knew this would end in mass death and part of me wishes i had never started the show because of that. going into the 8thbseason and my heart will be broken a dozen times over

why is the dragons fire blue? it should still be red/orange right? does that mean the dead army had blue blood if any at all?

i hope tormund doesn't die here at the wall, i hope when he dies it's fighting 

who will kill the night king? will he even lose? people were upset about the ending i know i'll be upset if he wins so it's a plausible theory

cersi is a dumb bitch and i can't wait to see her die. her pride/ignorance will kill countless people, she's one of the best villians and lena headey did a fantastic job playing her",0.05914130256913762,0.47393020782196016
385,"i've only two seasons left and i'm excited although i heard the finale was disappointing and had something to do with a dragon.

 i didn't except jon to come back, we've only had 1 fake out death and the character wasn't even major (leader of the brothers without banners) when an important character was dying like robb who was less injured then jon they didn't survive so to see him come back was a great surprise. 

cersi continues to manipulate tommen and it's crazy how she can't see how it's wrong. her redeeming quality is supposed to be how she loves her children but she doesn't.

cersi keeps talking for tommen and it gets more and more annoying everytime. i was starting to like jamie but because she's in cersi's pocket i'm starting not to like him. 

i hate the religious fanatics but i love that they're hurting the lannisters (really just cersi)

when will the lannisters go after dorne? cersi won't let them get away with her daughters murder. 

summer just died leaving only 2 dire wolves, ghost and arya's that ran off in the first season. 

the dead running through the tunnel is probably the coolest scene so far 

 i liked hodor, hoped he'd be one of the few to actually make it. 

bran us responsible for hodors disability, i wonder what he'll say about it

the dothraki coming up on the harpy's was an awesome sight

i hope to god that jon doesn't lose to the boltons. they've won twice already (against theon and stannis) and i hope they won't win a third. 

will jon and ramsay fight 1v1 and who will win if they do?

i would love to see ramsay and tormund fight at least verbally, compare their brutality and insanity

i feel like someone on the stark team will die, i think it's between davos, tormund, and rickon. maybe sansa but i think the rest are more likely

tormund is awesome (apart from all the raping, murdering, and every other crime) i think they're showing us how cool is he is because he's going to die. but at the same time davos us walking away from camp, maybe he'll get killed while on his walk. 

sometimes we get a hint at what'll happen, i don't think there was one this time

why hasn't the red woman tried to fuck jon again to make another demon shadow to kill ramsay? jon has kings blood in him like stannis and the blacksmith they were going to kill. 

i wonder if tyrion will die at all and if so how will he go out?

holy shit, the bolton army is huge, jon doesn't stand a chance. i really hope this won't be the slaughter it looks like it'll be. who will help jon last second, will it be the river run forces with brienne and pod? maybe sansas cousin will send his forces, whoever comes to help i hope they do it quickly

rickon is about to be killed by ramsay's dogs, he'll run and they'll chase (ramsay was just handed a bow so nevermind)

 the first stark child falls, who will be next?

jon reminds me of captain america, standing against impossible odds but still not giving up

jon fighting on the front line vs ramsay hiding behind his men really shows the difference in their leadership

i would love to see ramsay received similar torture to what he did to theon, he deserves worse but i don't see jon doing it, maybe sansa will

i hated cersi and wanted to see her die more than anything but now i'm hoping the faith will be slaughtered for their manipulation 

all of cersi's children are dead, will the starks meet the same fate?

daenerys says she wants to rule the seven kingdoms, does that mean she wants to sit on the iron throne only or that she wants to rule all of westros? i hope that she doesn't go to war with the starks. 

i don't think cersei knew tommen would kill himself otherwise why have the mountain prevent him from going to the trial but things have worked out in her favor almost like she planned for it all

so far the starks have stayed my favorite, i wish we had more time with rickon, we've come to know every stark child except for him and now we never will

i find it weird because other guessings of the age seemed to be pretty acurate, telling that for example bran was 17 in season 8 or that margaery was 14 at the beginning of the series (meaning she was 20 in season 6).

it seems they put it there to cut down the tension and make a few laughs and make sansa seem more powerful (and the scene really doesnt achieve any of this) yeah i know season 8 is all over the place and edmure was kind of a joke since he was introduced, but he spent years on a dungeon, give the guy some slack, and this is just stupid and out of the blue for the character, story etc. they should have cut it out that. it just makes the character worse, and really if it wasnt for this scene almost anyone wouldnt mock him. also what a waste on tobias menzies, they should had give him a villain role or well write edmund better. i read here that his character is way better in the books.",0.08465608465608468,0.46772486772486765

i just rewatched âthe long nightâ episode and i canât believe the lack of praise that episode got. even if iâm wrong i believe that had to be the greatest battle in game of thrones history. the dragons, the wights, the entire north with the dothraki and unsulliedâï¸. 

hell, if anyone paid attention iâm pretty sure they actually beat the army of the dead after the first round, it only became hopeless after the knight king resurrected everyone that just got killed ð.  it was a proper battle of the living versus the dead and after the victory i personally wouldâve rode to kings landing and burned that entire sh*t hole down just to get to cersi. call me petty but her own goddamn brother fought for the north and was willing to die for the living but not her selfish ass. 

then thereâs the arguments i hear the most. âwhy didnât jon killed the knight kingâ? the mf wasnât there for jon, you really think the knight king was gonna drop everything he was doing to have a 1v1 against some guy heâs almost killed twice. jon is my favorite character but cmon. âwhy the hell would the women and children go hide in a crypt if they know the knight king can bring back the deadâ? okay, where would you have put them? everyone knew there was a good chance the dead would storm into winter fell. arya was literally in the castle hiding from wights that broke in god knows when.

only dumb part to me is when the dorthraki rode into the dead army like maniacs and got slaughtered but hey, it looked cool for a minute lol. 

iâm sad the last half of season 8 couldnât live up to the half season finales greatness. the amount of plot holes oh my lord. iâm sure everyone was scratching their head when danaerysâ army just magically respawned. other than that, itâs just one mans opinion.",0.06970871505755226,0.5238372093023256

1. season 6 (action packed and actual good writing with insane dialogue and subplots)

#wounded warriors project 

so apparently jason mamoa has a much bigger impact on my sexual awakening as i thought...

he'd be the perfect unnamed vampire that becomes xunolus boyfriend. i didn't like this guy so i didn't give him much character development.. however 2 big things 

the first book creates a narrative that taught me a very valuable lesson at 10, so while reading the book worried my father, he let it go when i pointed out that ""it's just the bible but with zombies and dragons"" so he let it go 

however it opened up an incredible dialogue about consent that changed my life.

in the book she is 11 and he is 30. at 10 i didn't see a problem as mary had jesus at 14 so it's normal for a character like that.

while i didn't know what sex was, the scene of their wedding night was actually really romantic and taught me consent can happen even if you don't speak the same language you can still consent 

if you don't know the dialogue is exactly the same but it plays out like this...
he removes her clothing notices she is crying and wipes her tears while saying no. when he is done undressing her he distances himself saying no while removing his own clothing. he then removes his jewels and braids...finally he says no?

then she approaches him, takes his hand, guided it to where she wanted...finally whispering yes 

the other scene with the dragon eggs was romantic too. while they are intimate, she isn't used to riding horses...so she wasn't crying or scared because she didn't want to, she really wanted to she was just really sore. she even starts thinking about how she wishes she could look at him while it was happening, but it's not the dothraki way. however, in this moment she appreciates the dothraki way right now because if he knew she was crying she knew he would stop and she ""wasn't done yet"" so she focuses on the dragon eggs at the same time to make sure he doesn't notice she's crying 

i was so excited for these scenes in because 1...she was already being molested by her brother who she assumed for a long time she would marry. better to marry the evil she knows than this scary war tribe

2. while now that i'm an adult i understand this change was probably due to the fact that they had such a huge age gap...an 11 year old can not consent to a 30 year old so they probably where trying to tackle that issue, using the language barriers to rationalize it instead.

however, the solution was already there by closing the age gap. instead, they rob her of the beauty of her wedding night, and the beauty of there sexual relationship and the biblical narrative that women can enjoy sex a lot if its done right 

as a 10 year old who hit puberty at 9. it was a scary time cuz suddenly everything changed and the boys wouldn't leave my boobies alone and i thought it was just another part of the ""eve curse"". i knew what sex was, but it wasn't something for a woman to enjoy, it was her duty to keep her man faithful and have his babies)

to further add to the story.. apparently when i was 5 i basically decided that i was going to part of his ""harem"" when i grew up...

apparently i thought marriage was just a party you did when you want to be family/roommates cuz it's a sin to live with someone you're not married to so let's just say i had a really long with a clear top 4....

2 were from ""hawaii baywatch"" a redhead and jason mamoa. every time i came home from from a bad day of school there were 3 shows i demanded to see  cuz i needed to see my husband's and wives let's just say, steve urcle, mario lopez, kokoum, arielle, gaston (as the butler) jason mamoa and a redhead extra i saw in some sort of baywatch, and another unknown girl from another show. 

baywatch was particularly frustrating for him cuz i kept saying hawaii baywatch but he never knew what i meant cuz he never saw the redhead i was looking at and every time he asked where she was i'd say, your too late you already missed her in this episode 

but it was my obvious favorite and i didn't get way he was so confused when i asked for it all the time.

then it was our ""first trip to disney"" (he just told me it was an audition and he was kind of hoping i didn't get any part, but also didn't want to sabatoge my dream if that's what i really did know i wanted for myself).

so when he asked if i was ready to see if i could be a disney princess, i thought he meant that i was getting married and i was so excited about planning the wedding he couldn't stop me...so i begged him to get me ""all the ring pops"" so i can propose to my favorite characters!!!

then we would live there and the men...(gaston and john smith) would make all the money and do all the cooking and cleaning while i married ""my prince charming"" (jason mamoa) and as many princesses i could find to make it ""more fun""

fast forward to my teen years...and i can't remember the movie but again, he was there but native american this time so while he was familiar i didn't recognize him...just thought the main characters daughter was really cute...then there's a scene where she meets him at a casino and they flirt every time her dad wasn't paying attention. while i remember the scene, i don't remember any details but my dad said i kept crying i kept doing it till i started crying and when he kept asking me why all i could say was ""i really don't get it but i know god is listening to my thoughts as i'm trying to figure it out...i'm pretty sure no matter what i do i'm going to hell.

now that i'm an adult i see that 
1. he married a woman i can recognize and was on my list of potential princess candidates...

2. now that i know it wasn't 3 guys but 1 jason mamoa 

3. he marries daenerys in the show 

4. now that i'm all grown up, he still causes me so much confusion. i don't know if i want to be him, try to purchase ""a big penis"" so i can fight him for the women in his life, or if i want to actually sleep with him myself

5. to make matters worse...i just had a thought and during the research i was doing i came across an interview about a ""fuzzy pink sock"" so now the idea of either fighting him or sleeping with him makes me want to pee my pants....

6. all i can say is if i were to ""get a big penis to compete with"" it would have to get an impossibly large one to compete...the nature of this concept makes me think of cthulu...so yeah, my penis is cthulu and it's bigger then jason mamoas and i get to keep my cool boobs...

so now i'm thinking of a story like this 
xunolu is vampire boys first wife (based on jason mamoas current irl wife)
chrystalynn was originally a surface elf so while it was an attempt to save her life, the dark nature of vampire powers corrupted her natural life energy causing her to have an existential crisis that drove her to madness...she became terrorist #1because reality became distorted and enhanced her ptsd so she went into survival mode...

since another issue i grew up with was being called casper, albino, since i'm white but my dad is mixed but looks very black...we even got a dna test to prove he actually was my father because i was positive i was either adopted or switched at birth because being in a multicultural household, where my brothers and i were the only white people there...so it's only natural for me to be the terrorist #2/kahleesi

so basically, xunolu, vampire are together and meet kahleesi saving her life because she was the last human as there is a race war, but humans wiped themselves out because they were too busy waring over what human should have the iron thrown to know that terrorists were planning to make their move to overthrow humanity. despite being saved, being human meant that she was immune to gaining any powers. knowing that they decide to protect her, eventually forming a power throuple, which greatly extended her life...every time she ""dies"" they bite her to bring her back 

they decided to work together to win the iron throne, making xunolu head queen because she already naturally had dark magic that she had under control by being drow, but being also a vampire amplifies her dark magic so she is the most powerful of the 3

however, once in power it became clear they had very different versions of what paradise means 

xunolu wants a strict military society (qunari/dragon age)

vampire as an issue as it removes all forms of freedom including freedom of thought. he thought the solution was easy, turn everyone in the world into vampires and people would stop fighting...

kahleesi argues it isn't that simple, as people would rather be free in chaos that prescribe to conformity in paradise....

but at the end of the day xunolu was head queen and it was her decision. at first it was paradise. everything was simple, no one had to think for themselves or worry about comfort and security 

but 1000 years later, terrorism happens because the people wanted ""give me liberty or give me death""

vampire goes, that's my cue, death....
so he starts converting everyone thinking  the experience he had with crystalyn was just a rare fluke...but forcing creatures with natural light magic into vampires with dark magic caused insanity death and another long war...this time the vampires are all wiped out through genocide...

kahleesi decides she just wants to die now, but for the first time...nothing works. later realizes there's powerful magic in love and blood and she is possibly immortal 

she becomes ""bran"" through her own strength but immediately burns the throne and introduces democracy before running away.  

then she lives a quiet life as a bard, eventually creating the ""bards alliance/friends of red jenny""

as this alliance focuses on using the expressive arts  as a form of therapy and coping with all the war around us...

but as we got more and more famous as bards and an alliance , mental health issues were being tackled and while she ran as far as she could from her original country...

her ideas changed the culture and diplomacy of the already diplomatic country she resides in ""hawaii""

then hawaii takes over the world...not through power or strength, but through the aloha spirit. finally lasting peace is obtained and she visits the grave, saying she never thought she would ever return. she is incredibly old at this point almost like a skeleton..no one even remembers who she is anymore but her stories and songs were taught to the current generation in school and she becomes a history professor in a small local town.

she tries one more time to kill herself, but it just ends up with her becoming young again...she laughs as she says, ""well i guess i somehow got stuck in the heaven you made for me, or maybe i am already dead...either way, i spend my time making sure people remember you for who you both really were...

and that's the end
goodbye 

so now here is a song dedicated to all creators and entertainment...if you see this and have any ideas or pointers, especially with transitions because ""and suddenly we are fighting people in outerspace wouldn't work...

p.s. shout out to rick and morty for jessica because now she is a time god and i'd be totally cool with them using my ideas for her arch...just be sure to #warning: i may need to take a shit soon, where's my battle buddy if you guys decide to use my ideas...maybe she could even become rick's new nemesis in a weird way...or...if the theory that rick and morty are the same, maybe she really is alluding to the fact that she just saw the future and knows she's his grandma now...it would be fun to see them try to make that work

but here's the song...ps, dan harmon, since harmonquest exists, i'd love if we could play d&d to improve the work of season 8 d&d....

so again... a song dedicated to fellow artists

show me show me show me how you do that trick 

the one that makes me scream she said

the one that makes me laugh she said 

and threw her arms around my head

show me how you do it!

and i promise you i promise you 

i'll run away with you 

i'll run away with you

spinning on that dizzy edge 
i kissed her face 
i kissed her head
and dreamed of all the different ways i had to make her glow

why are you so far away she said

how could you ever know 

that i'm inlove with you

i'm in love with you

you one and only 
you lost and lonely 
resisting in the waters 

your just like dream!
your just like a dream!

daylight licks me into shape 
i must have been asleep for days
in moving lips i breathe your name
and open up my eyes

i found myself alone alone alone above a raging sea
who stole the only one i loved
and drowned her deep inside of me

you one and only 
you just like heaven

murmaider murmaider murmaider 
go into the water
live there 
die there 

we reject your land empires
lungs transform to take in water
on on on we swim through our dreams 

swim and swim and swim on
we swim home

let's ride

go into the water 
live there die there!
it's home!
#the art of drowning

finally the hills are without eyes 
they were tired of watching a dead man's face
red with their own blood..

they used to love
having so much to lose
close your just once and see everything in ruin

what's left to be alive???

did you ever read what i wrote you?
did you ever hear what i told you?
did you ever listen to a word we played 
or did you just let the wrong things in

did we get this high just feel your pain?
did we play just to be pawns in your game?
how blind could you be don't you see 
you took the wrong road 
but we're here waiting 
bye bye beautiful!

how blind can you be don't you see
how blind can you be don't you see

did we get this high just to feel your pain?
did we play just to be pawns in your game 
how blind can you be don't you see 
you took the wrong road but we'll be waiting 
bye bye beautiful 
bye by beautiful!

this beautiful tragedy
is crashing into me
this dying destiny 
take me away

will you be there for me? or will you be
the death of me 
oh my beautiful tragedy 

silent nights 
let me sleep away the memories within
sacrifices of purity is turning me to sin
and this judgement day is growing near
and this confession
is killing me again 

this beautiful tragedy 
is crashing into me
this dying destiny 
take me away....

my girl she's a column
in the million pages written 
since the universe existed 
and every little piece of mind

she provides 
just the strength i need 
let's me breathe 
let's me breath
cuz 

i'm in love with a ghost 
why don't you haunt me in my dreams 
please possess me while i sleep so i could lock you up inside my head and never let you leave me here with my heart in my hands i'm here with my heart in my hands now 

cuz yes your the star beneath the stairs 
yes your my ghost upon the stage

tears are falling down 
but i'm still holding on
finding strength i never knew

and try to be like you!

you are my guiding star!

#changes

the nk - i would change the night king entirely. instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. this is a major change and makes the nk not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. i would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. he's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. another change i would make to the nk is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#omission

mad queen, dothraki, golden company, and euron - with only 13 episodes left i feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#season 7

the nk gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the shadow tower overlooks (kinda like in harry potter with the dementors. this is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) with the assault of the castle arya, theon, and sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are bran, jon, davos, ed, sam, melisandre, tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

instead of arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

sansa goes to the eyrie with brienne and pod to convince robin to send the entirety of the vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which jon has commandeered. upon his return jon offers up the north to bran but bran refuses. bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows jon is the better leader they need. bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. with the 3er having died prematurely bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. i would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

the nk slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. a few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants. (this would have been a scene with her speaking to jorah while overlooking the civilians of mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would dany then begin her sail to westeros. not to conquer but to save.

#beginning of season 8

with the loss of winterfell jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. with the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

in this scenario arya hasn't killed walder. jon meets up and gathers with arya, blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), sansa, bran, beric, thoros, yara, theon, and the hound.

thoros, beric, and the hound have been protecting the small folk from walder's rule. (instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

the nk continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

the taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting arya. while arya will be the 1 to kill walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving edmure. it'll be some assassin's creed shit. also would have more scenes with walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

the following episodes will mostly focus on dany sailing and arya's infiltration of the twins. before killing walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. this will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive arya. (little tangent i do think in the books walder is holding his body i'll bet money on it.) also bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

with the fall of walder arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. with the surrender of the remaining freys the starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. instead of genociding the remaining freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. in this scenario baelish and robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall i say manipulation he has over the boy. i would also give scenes to robin and royce and show the impact and the positive influence royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

with the twins now fortified with greyjoys, starks, tully's, arryn, and frey the nk descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

while the battle would start heavily in jon's favor the neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. with nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the nk's favor. yara, robin, the blackfish, and sam would die here. yara fighting by theon's side, the blackfish arya's, and robin protecting sansa. in his final moments robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

with the blackfish and arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. in his final time he would attempt to consulate arya by telling her ""i never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

as the dead start coming over the wall dany's forces would sweep in. while there is joyous, confusion and relief with dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. ok now hear me out. it obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(like that scene from lotr where saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) it would be similar to that. the nk is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. he watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with dany's arrival. (and chucking spears like tom brady is just stupid.)

as dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. she's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (this is 1 time i thing slow motion could work perhaps with jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

with her untimely death the nk retreats his forces. again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. the nk is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

with the death of dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to kings landing with dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

upon their mother and brother's death both raegal and viserys fly away and take residence in harrenhall. why harrenhall? idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. that shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. and got 1 season left ain't got time to go to volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. this would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

edit  - having a scene of kinvara trying to talk dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#end of season 8

having lost the twins our heroes head further south. towards king's landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the vale and holding the nk at the bloody gate. this is however decided against as jon knows the bloody gate and vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

sansa argues taking casterly rock and making their final fight there. but as jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. he knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. not only that but if jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

as they make their way to kl it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. varys mentions they're in harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. jon would make his leave at night telling only arya his mission. to attempt to tame these beasts. in this story nobody knows jon is a targareyen. neither bran or sam found out so not even jon knows. this is a huge risk but jon sees this as his only hope.

the following episodes would be jon entering harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. this wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. this could also be the revelation that jon is a targareyen but i think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

while jon tames raegal and viscerys it mirrors scenes of the nk taming drogon. this is not an easy feat for the nk however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. this would at least be 2 episodes. 

you would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. war is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. they knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. only tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. cersei already knows he didn't kill joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. this would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as jaime is gone. tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. she's alone and scared of whatever killed jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. she only agrees to protect tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

with a distant roar our heroes think it to be jon but instead it's the nk. in this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) as drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. with bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. it is too late however. as the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (not just a few bricks.) dead drogon with the nk on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

sansa with bran now inside king's landing finds a safe place to lay him down. bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

greyworm with jorah, beric, thoros, theon still hold the shield wall. as the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062

#changes

the nk - i would change the night king entirely. instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. this is a major change and makes the nk not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. i would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. he's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. another change i would make to the nk is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#omission

mad queen, dothraki, golden company, and euron - with only 13 episodes left i feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#season 7

the nk gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the shadow tower overlooks (kinda like in harry potter with the dementors. this is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) with the assault of the castle arya, theon, and sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are bran, jon, davos, ed, sam, melisandre, tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

instead of arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

sansa goes to the eyrie with brienne and pod to convince robin to send the entirety of the vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which jon has commandeered. upon his return jon offers up the north to bran but bran refuses. bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows jon is the better leader they need. bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. with the 3er having died prematurely bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. i would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

the nk slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. a few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants. (this would have been a scene with her speaking to jorah while overlooking the civilians of mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would dany then begin her sail to westeros. not to conquer but to save.

#beginning of season 8

with the loss of winterfell jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. with the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

in this scenario arya hasn't killed walder. jon meets up and gathers with arya, blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), sansa, bran, beric, thoros, yara, theon, and the hound.

thoros, beric, and the hound have been protecting the small folk from walder's rule. (instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

the nk continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

the taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting arya. while arya will be the 1 to kill walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving edmure. it'll be some assassin's creed shit. also would have more scenes with walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

the following episodes will mostly focus on dany sailing and arya's infiltration of the twins. before killing walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. this will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive arya. (little tangent i do think in the books walder is holding his body i'll bet money on it.) also bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

with the fall of walder arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. with the surrender of the remaining freys the starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. instead of genociding the remaining freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. in this scenario baelish and robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall i say manipulation he has over the boy. i would also give scenes to robin and royce and show the impact and the positive influence royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

with the twins now fortified with greyjoys, starks, tully's, arryn, and frey the nk descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

while the battle would start heavily in jon's favor the neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. with nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the nk's favor. yara, robin, the blackfish, and sam would die here. yara fighting by theon's side, the blackfish arya's, and robin protecting sansa. in his final moments robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

with the blackfish and arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. in his final time he would attempt to consulate arya by telling her ""i never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

as the dead start coming over the wall dany's forces would sweep in. while there is joyous, confusion and relief with dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. ok now hear me out. it obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(like that scene from lotr where saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) it would be similar to that. the nk is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. he watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with dany's arrival. (and chucking spears like tom brady is just stupid.)

as dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. she's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (this is 1 time i thing slow motion could work perhaps with jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

with her untimely death the nk retreats his forces. again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. the nk is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

with the death of dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to kings landing with dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

upon their mother and brother's death both raegal and viserys fly away and take residence in harrenhall. why harrenhall? idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. that shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. and got 1 season left ain't got time to go to volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. this would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

edit  - having a scene of kinvara trying to talk dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#end of season 8

having lost the twins our heroes head further south. towards king's landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the vale and holding the nk at the bloody gate. this is however decided against as jon knows the bloody gate and vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

sansa argues taking casterly rock and making their final fight there. but as jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. he knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. not only that but if jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

as they make their way to kl it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. varys mentions they're in harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. jon would make his leave at night telling only arya his mission. to attempt to tame these beasts. in this story nobody knows jon is a targareyen. neither bran or sam found out so not even jon knows. this is a huge risk but jon sees this as his only hope.

the following episodes would be jon entering harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. this wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. this could also be the revelation that jon is a targareyen but i think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

while jon tames raegal and viscerys it mirrors scenes of the nk taming drogon. this is not an easy feat for the nk however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. this would at least be 2 episodes. 

you would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. war is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. they knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. only tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. cersei already knows he didn't kill joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. this would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as jaime is gone. tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. she's alone and scared of whatever killed jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. she only agrees to protect tyrion but all the others have been left out.

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them.

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon.

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

during the siege of winterfell tormund would sacrifice himself for jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in jon's arms(attempting to tell jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) when jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(not going into great detail) jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time davos and ed have already died defending the wall. jaime and the lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only bran, jon, melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. the closest thing i could imagine it to would be the battle for minas tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

after robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom sansa meets up with jon and bran either in moat cailin or white harbor. 

in this story dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. she puts the citizens needs before her wants. (this would have been a scene with her speaking to jorah while overlooking the civilians of mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would dany then begin her sail to westeros. not to conquer but to save.

#beginning of season 8

with the loss of winterfell jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. with the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

in this scenario arya hasn't killed walder. jon meets up and gathers with arya, blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), sansa, bran, beric, thoros, yara, theon, and the hound.

thoros, beric, and the hound have been protecting the small folk from walder's rule. (instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

the nk continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

the taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting arya. while arya will be the 1 to kill walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving edmure. it'll be some assassin's creed shit. also would have more scenes with walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

the following episodes will mostly focus on dany sailing and arya's infiltration of the twins. before killing walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. this will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive arya. (little tangent i do think in the books walder is holding his body i'll bet money on it.) also bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

with the fall of walder arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. with the surrender of the remaining freys the starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. instead of genociding the remaining freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. in this scenario baelish and robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall i say manipulation he has over the boy. i would also give scenes to robin and royce and show the impact and the positive influence royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

with the twins now fortified with greyjoys, starks, tully's, arryn, and frey the nk descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

while the battle would start heavily in jon's favor the neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. with nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the nk's favor. yara, robin, the blackfish, and sam would die here. yara fighting by theon's side, the blackfish arya's, and robin protecting sansa. in his final moments robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

with the blackfish and arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. in his final time he would attempt to consulate arya by telling her ""i never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

as the dead start coming over the wall dany's forces would sweep in. while there is joyous, confusion and relief with dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. ok now hear me out. it obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(like that scene from lotr where saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) it would be similar to that. the nk is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. he watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with dany's arrival. (and chucking spears like tom brady is just stupid.)

as dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. she's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (this is 1 time i thing slow motion could work perhaps with jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

with her untimely death the nk retreats his forces. again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. the nk is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

with the death of dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to kings landing with dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

upon their mother and brother's death both raegal and viserys fly away and take residence in harrenhall. why harrenhall? idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. that shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. and got 1 season left ain't got time to go to volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. this would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

edit  - having a scene of kinvara trying to talk dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#end of season 8

having lost the twins our heroes head further south. towards king's landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the vale and holding the nk at the bloody gate. this is however decided against as jon knows the bloody gate and vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

sansa argues taking casterly rock and making their final fight there. but as jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. he knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. not only that but if jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

as they make their way to kl it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. varys mentions they're in harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. jon would make his leave at night telling only arya his mission. to attempt to tame these beasts. in this story nobody knows jon is a targareyen. neither bran or sam found out so not even jon knows. this is a huge risk but jon sees this as his only hope.

the following episodes would be jon entering harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. this wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. this could also be the revelation that jon is a targareyen but i think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

while jon tames raegal and viscerys it mirrors scenes of the nk taming drogon. this is not an easy feat for the nk however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. this would at least be 2 episodes. 

you would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. war is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. they knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. only tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. cersei already knows he didn't kill joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. this would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as jaime is gone. tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. she's alone and scared of whatever killed jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. she only agrees to protect tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

with a distant roar our heroes think it to be jon but instead it's the nk. in this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) as drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. with bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. it is too late however. as the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (not just a few bricks.) dead drogon with the nk on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

sansa with bran now inside king's landing finds a safe place to lay him down. bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

greyworm with jorah, beric, thoros, theon still hold the shield wall. as the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062
680,"i'll try not to alter too much what happened prior to season 7. instead of happening in season 8 the battle for winterfell would happen at the very end of season 7. this not a total play by play, i do not go into a whole lot of detail and this is just how i would've taken the story. you'll notice i do not write much on tyrion, varys, or bealish but it's not because they don't do anything but because i'm only focusing on the biggest set pieces. 

#changes

the nk - i would change the night king entirely. instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. this is a major change and makes the nk not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. i would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. he's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. another change i would make to the nk is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#omission

mad queen, dothraki, golden company, and euron - with only 13 episodes left i feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#season 7

the nk gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the shadow tower overlooks (kinda like in harry potter with the dementors. this is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) with the assault of the castle arya, theon, and sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are bran, jon, davos, ed, sam, melisandre, tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

instead of arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

sansa goes to the eyrie with brienne and pod to convince robin to send the entirety of the vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which jon has commandeered. upon his return jon offers up the north to bran but bran refuses. bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows jon is the better leader they need. bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. with the 3er having died prematurely bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. i would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

the nk slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. a few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

theon gets word of jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. he attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the starks. big difference being yara supports theon's request this time. balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a civil war against his children. yara and theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. this would fulfill theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the starks. also giving more development to both yara and theon. (similar to euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining theon or yara like in the show.)

while the starks have been dealing with the dead, jaime, uncle kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and dorne. having slaughtered house tyrell (i'd keep olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the sand snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. he leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the tully family. jaime after hearing of jon's call for aid would call off his assault of sunspear and answer it against cersei's order. he would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago.

with a distant roar our heroes think it to be jon but instead it's the nk. in this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) as drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. with bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. it is too late however. as the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(not going into great detail.)

qyburn would take the mountain and abandon cersei. this scene would end with qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while cersei cries as she is alone. tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of drogon. tyrion and cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. after killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. as then they would be truly alone. i would keep cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. tyrion. she holds tyrion the way she does jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (not just a few bricks.) dead drogon with the nk on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

sansa with bran now inside king's landing finds a safe place to lay him down. bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

the hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

greyworm with jorah, beric, thoros, theon still hold the shield wall. as the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

as just then jon then comes onto the battle with raegal and viscerys. jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the nk off and falling several hundred feet.

drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both dragons. as both raegal and viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore drogon would make his way to jon. 

bran having seen jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. bran makes the decision to warg into drogon. (this is not only an animal bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. the exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) bran forces drogon onto the nk's own men. as he destroys more and more dead sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. she begs bran to come back and to get out of drogon but bran knows what he must do and flies towards the nk. his shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. bran dies before making it to the nk. in a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) a cat, rat, bird, dog, nymeria but to no avail. he dies in sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and arya did many years ago.

jon along with beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the nk has fallen but jon takes a spear in the leg and beric is cut down before him. theon runs to his side and jon tells him to retreat into the walls. theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. he protects jon but ultimately would die before jon's eyes.

greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to jorah and save him. having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (dany and barristan) he will not fail again. bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

drogon would be making his way towards jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. the hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. both the bolt and the hound are swallowed up in flames. he dies screaming along with the men around him. while he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

on the field jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. the nk just out of reach. the nk raises the dead around jon and he comes face to face with theon. unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 ned did before ilyn payne killed him. before theon brings the blade down onto jon, the nk is stabbed in the back by beric. beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. a man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. as the nk dies so does all of his followers. 

jon grabs theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

beric having killed the nk collapses with thoros running to his side. beric makes something out only thoros can hear. something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" beric dies in thoro's arm. rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's beric rest in peace. as his watch has ended.

#fast forward to the end

i would ultimately have jon rule the north. even if he does find out he's a targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" the 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

i would have sansa and gendry rule westeros. as a call back to where it all started. sansa going off to wed robert's son. she's finally finished what she started.

arya goes to travel essos with thoros. (not going west of westeros like some dora explorer bullshit.)

baelish would rule the eyrie as robin left him charge and house arryn is now extinct.

oberyn's daughters would rule dorne, edmure riverrun, and kevan lannister the westerlands. 

give tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

north of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. while the nk died he did save those he loved. again taking out him being a full blown villain. being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

edit - also sansa and gendry would order the death of lyanna mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",0.048855125100887846,0.4670024213075062

a lot of shows i nitpick about the dialogue i donât know if i just love this series extra so iâm bias but even watching it over (on season 5) canât find any really bad dialogue i think a lot came from the books which i read so maybe thatâs why

also watching it with my mom (is reason for rewatch) and she thought she was going to hate it and is obsessed with it though she calls it âhouse of thronesâ or âlord of the rings â¦ thatâs not lord of the ringsâ i feel bad for her knowing how bad season 8 is but i really wanted her to love diana rigg as much as i do",-0.19999999999999993,0.5599999999999999
692,"  

i have watched the show sporadically, though i did experience the whole mess season 8 was, but i have read all five of the books and there are two things i'm really wondering about.

the first one is about catelyn. i disliked her on the show but for some reason i really liked her in the books. i mean maybe some of it was because i had sympathy for her knowing that the red wedding is coming (spoiled before reading check) but i felt respect for her in a way. i mean she was really intelligent, at least compared to robb who, at least at the books, seemed so annoying to me. he was really arrogant, thankfully not in joffrey way, but catelyn was way smarter and seemed to know better about politics and stuff but noone would listen to her. so yeah, i just see that she gets a lot of hate while robb doesn't as much and i think the opposite would make more sense.

now about cersei, i find her to be very interesting even though she is nuts and insane, probably because she is all that and i think that she get more credit for being an idiot than she deserves about all the decisions she makes when she gets a pov and because of her arrogance, but at the point she gets a pov she is already so messed up with all that has happened. at least through other povs in the first books she seemed smarter. i just think that her arrogance and obsessions blind her (don't get me wrong, i hate her as much as everyone else) but that's not what i wanted to say at all. i'm just really wondering what do you think is gonna happen with her in the next book (if it ever gets published). it seems like there's a plan for her, but i really don't understand what. i don't think they'll follow the show on this.

what do you think is gonna happen with or to her in the next book?

do you think the next book will ever be published?

and what do you think of catelyn actually?",-0.049305555555555554,0.4446759259259259
693,"i'm just curious because i see a lot of people hating on it because it undermines what a great guy jaime was but i think it's 1 of the few things (maybe the only thing) season 8 does right. 

i don't like his thicc ass plot armor (or that he survived the long night) but i don't think jaime was this great guy everyone sees. this is the same man who raped his sister next to her son's corpse and threatened to catapult edmure's baby at a stone wall. 

yes he saved half a million people at king's landing but why? was it just for them? not for his father? himself? the fact he constantly says he'll do anything to see cersei again? 

had tywin ordered the death of everyone at king's landing would he have stopped him? would he oppose his own family to save civilians? he didn't do anything when the targaryen children were being murdered. because it didn't harm him or his family in any way. cersei blows up the sept and he still stays by her side. 

a bad character can do good things. example both stannis and baelish have done good things but they're far from being good people. the books might head in a different direction but as far as the show goes i don't think this out of character for jaime to go back. they showed us time and time again he is a selfish person. giving brienne armor to repay a debt is a nice thing but again baelish saving sansa was a nice thing. him being nice to your favorite character (tyrion and brienne) doesn't make him a nice person. 1 is family the other is a friend. but what about civilians? he's never showed cared for them. 

but feel free to disagree and if there are any spelling errors my bad.

edit - also him killing cersei would've done absolutely nothing as dany mawn lowers the city anyways and only does a drive by at the red keep. so him killing her would've essentially just been for the sake of him killing her and not the saving of anybody.

i fucking loved season 8. no joke.

when i first saw it, i was kind of mixed, but definitely more positive about it than other people. rewatching it made me appreciate it even more. i think what helped was already knowing how it would end and not thinking of all the theories that could happen.

daenerysâ fall was very believable to me. people donât really realize this, but she wasnât afraid to spill blood during her time in essos, even those who arenât completely evil. but with the love of all the people there, her worst impulses were checked. seeing her come to westeros, losing more than winning, seeing the people there flat out reject her, finding out the man she loves is the biggest threat to her claim (a throne she full heartedly belonged to her since viserys died) definitely hit her ego hard. it wasnât all easy obviously, but when she was in essos towards the later seasons, she was winning like mj in the 90âs. the biggest hits to her were when she lost her dragons and missandei, her best friend. yeah, no shit sheâd want to kill everyone and start a new world full of people who loved her. in the end, she was the worst villain in the showâs history. gave me big thanos endgame vibes.

jonâs story was perfect, especially the ending. game of thrones is all about putting down the mythical hero legend in favor of realistic expectations. jon being a noble, good hearted, humble guy who finds out heâs the heir to the throne? sure it would work in other stories, but not here. and if he did sit on the throne, heâd be unhappy. he got his happy ending by going back to the north up with tormund and ghost. he gets to be free and live his life. yes i know his sentence was to be a part of the nights watch, but with the unsullied leaving and his family being the most powerful people in westeros, i donât think anyone would give a shit if he decided to live among the wildlings.

sansa was badass. i didnât like her story the first time i saw it but now that i saw the series again, i really did buy into her growth. she goes from an innocent little girl to an intelligent, savvy political operator, while still keeping her good heart and loyalty. itâs these characters that are the heroes of game of thrones. the smart ones who are willing to do what it takes to win for the people, not because of some lofty ideal or their personal ambition.

aryaâs story was alright early in the show but i did definitely appreciated that she killed the night king. it wouldâve been a waste to have her train for years without actually doing something big.

now on the night king and how the white walkers died in one episode. i donât think the point of the show was to have the white walkers wage a full out war with the living for an entire season, itâs how this world ending crisis would kill everyone unless they put their petty differences aside. and for the most part, they did. the night kingâs impact changed the course of the world forever. after all, he killed daenerysâ dragon and gave cersei the opportunity to press her forces while everyone else dealt with him, definitely putting daenerys on the path to be a psychotic killer. the long night was a terrific episode. what changed my view on it was by not treating it like some epic battle like helmâs deep in lotr, it was just purely surviving hell. the darkness helped with creating such a sense of dread and fear. itâs not about winning some big battle, itâs about realizing you have no chance fighting head on, and praying your hail mary would work.

bran as king? yes. why wouldnât we want someone who has his powers being the king? forget the valiant heroes and idealists, they are terrible leaders (in real life too). we need the all knowing, non ambitious people. 

the cinematography and music was some of the greatest, not just in the show, but in all of tv and movies.

there were definitely some issues, but overall, i really really loved season 8. i donât care what anyone else says, i think itâs a terrific ending. downvote me to hell.",0.15324694513524298,0.5350599459642011

season 8 did seem to have a lot of plot crammed into each episode but i felt like they wrapped up everyoneâs storylines pretty well-except for maybe jonâs, who seemed pretty miserable.

in season 8, while daenerys is discussing her love for jon with sansa, instead of someone interrupting, daenerys confessed that she intended to rule the seven kingdoms with jon by her side.  hence the song of ice and fire.  ice and fire uniting to bring peace to the world.

instead of jorja mormont saving daenerys when she is trapped in the long night, she finds herself completely alone and surrounded.  there is no hope until her wounded dragon finally returns and saves her.  soon after, jon and daenerys both ride dragons with the armies to kings landing and take the throne without causing needless mass destruction.  i dont have an opinion with what happens to cersei but i would want the show to end with jon marrying daenerys.

at the battle for winterfell i think jamie should have died, as it would have completed his redemption arc, dying while fighting in winterfell along with the north, the same place he pushed bran out the window. would have been a meaningful moment for him to die defending brienne who in my opinion he loved more than cersei.

also a few more major characters should have died in the battle, seemed a bit lackluster for me that the named characters that did die like lady mormont and the night watch commander (can't remember his name) were small roles, the biggest loss was probably jorah and theon but with it being the long night, the thing that had been teased from day 1, it should have been a lot more deadly.

with jamie's death it would open up the possibility for arya to use jamie's face to return to kings landing and finally kill cersei after years of waiting, the show could have pulled a massive misdirect and only shown jamie's death as a flashback when he(arya) kills cersei. there could be a few scene of jamie and briene travelling to kings landing and talking about what they are going to do after it was all over of whatever, but we don't know it's arya at that point, something like that.

how excatly arya would kill cersei i've yet to decide but it would either be really brutal or really emotional and meaningful, or both i guess, but it would be a better death for jamie and cersei, rather than ya know, getting crushed by some rubble caused by dani going full mad queen.

which leaves the death of the night king up to someone else so that ayra doesn't seem massively op, maybe bran could weaken the night king somehow because they are supposed to have a deep connection, maybe he could have actually been the bait all along but not in the way he explained to the others, and that would leave the night king weak enough for theon to take him down, completing his redemption arc, helping save the boy who he once lied about burning alive. 

with theon surviving, and the iron islands no longer needing to be held by yara incase of the loss of the long night, theon and yara could be at the battle of kings landing fighting off against euron so the battle took place over land and sea and seemed like a larger scale battle, the fight between jamie and euron that happened in the show would be replaced with euron and yara, euron would probably win in a straight fight but something could happen to turn the tide, maybe theon could be ramming cannon fire into the ship they are fighting on and euron gets caught by some debris, then ultimately yara ends up winning and killing euron and becomes the first queen of the iron islands after the battle.

i love the show and although the last season isn't on par with the rest i still really liked it but i feel like it could have been better, interested to see if you guys agree that any of this sounds better, or what if anything you would change about it.",0.10470328282828283,0.5383838383838383
881,"i don't understand the tention between jon and dany on s8 of got. by this point, daenarys has proven herself to be a conqueror and ruler of the people. from the beginning, her aim was to break the wheel. she freed the slaves in the east and left dario to rule over marine, by the end of season 8, before she gets in knife stuck in her, she has a long way to go to achieve this goal. it seems to me that would make sense for her to continue her pursuit of this goal, leaving a loyal, loved and trusted ruler (jon snow), as she did in the past, and travel the rest of the world in search of injustice. perhaps taking a look at the west of westeros with arya. thoughts?",0.14666666666666667,0.45666666666666667
908,"i watched the show in real time as it aired, which was difficult as by the latter seasons i had forgotten a lot of the details of the early seasons. the end was a shock and disappointment to me as it was to many.

but then i re-watched the series within a couple of months and the continuity of the story and characters held up much better in the re-watch. yes, it's true, certain things seemed rather far-fetched, such as varys throwing his normal caution to the wind, but by and large the main problem i'd had with the show in the first viewing was drastically reduced.

dany's nature doesn't really change throughout the show. if you re-watch it you will see dany as the ruthless tyrant she is destined to become, even in the earlier seasons. like most tyrants, she is generous and kind to those who are faithful and obedient to her. in the early seasons, when she kills people, we are rooting for her because we think the people she's killing suck.

the assault on king's landing episode is actually quite powerful if you look at it and ignore dany. the fact that the northerners turn into murdering rapists is more interesting and sad than anything dany does - it shows the true horror of warfare. they're supposed to be the good guys.

and this episode is the one time that i find dany acts out of character and it makes little sense. everything she does up to the ringing of the bells is fine and consistent with her character. was the writing as good in season 8 as season 1-4? no. but dany's character consistency is mostly fine. up to the ringing of the bells.

cercei and her army were backstabbers. dany and her army literally saved the world and cercei sat there and waited to stab them in the back. it would be like - imagine aliens attacked earth and, like a hollywood movie, the usa tried to rally the world's militaries in defense. imagine the major powers agreed to put aside their differences and fight the aliens together. imagine it's a brutal war with astronomical casualties, but we somehow pull it off. except one country, china, decided to sit the war out and build up their army, and when the aliens are finally defeated china goes on a rampage and  invades the usa. it would be the most evil thing a nation has ever done in the history of our species. by sitting the war out for their own personal gain, they would have put the entire human species in jeopardy. i would consider it the worst betrayal in history, the worst crime.

this is what cercei does. the army of the dead seems to be about to exterminate all life and it seems the night king will win, and yet dany fights against him despite the odds, and cercei uses the events to her advantage. it's a truly evil betrayal and cercei and the entire lannister army deserve to be vaporized by dragonfire. the golden company too.

so dany flying around and nuking the shit out of the army makes sense. if she had completely blown up the red keep that would make sense too. ~~but why does she take her time flying up and down the streets to burn the irrelevant peasants running away? that makes no sense.~~

~~she's trying to conquer the city, to live in it, to sit on the throne. it makes no sense for her to turn it to ash first. she's not even getting revenge on anyone at that point. it would even make more sense for her to burn down casterly rock, or blow up the iron bank. the city of king's landing has been her dream her whole life. burning it and all the people within it is unexplainable.~~

~~and that scene, where she takes off after the bells ring, looking at the red keep... and then spends hours burning everything other than the red keep - that makes no sense.~~

i've read the explanations offered in this thread and i thought about the dialogue in the last episode more and yes, even dany's burning of kl does make sense and is consistent with her character. i think most of us still agree it was a dick move of d&d to condense the final two seasons and this descent into genocide should have been given more than one episode, but ultimately it is consistent with dany's previous path/trajectory.

945,"the endless debate about the quality of season 8 overlooks the truth. the truth is that the reaction was so severe that it killed the franchise. iirc there were three spin-offs proposed, we now only have one, merchandise disappeared from shops almost overnight, and so on. hbo must have been spitting blood. i hope they can reboot with house of the dragon, but it still means hugely expensive lost opportunities. 

i don't accept the argument that it had anything to do with favourite characters being killed - there were favourite characters being killed here there and anywhere all through - ned stark, red wedding, etc. 

imo it was that the behaviour of **almost every** character in the last season defied the logic of the character build up leading to there. yes, if it had had more episodes then it might have made more sense, but as it was it simply didn't.  add that to people's ability to levitate from one end of the country to the other, nonsense like hiding in the crypt from dead people, and the weapons that were deadly in one episode and helpless in the next, and it simply destroyed one's belief in the fictional world created. 

that kind of thing sometimes happens in books too, usually when an author gets stuck with a character or series that (s)he no longer likes. even sherlock holmes suffers from it a bit.",-0.05714285714285713,0.38599773242630386

1203,"well, iâve been on this subreddit for three days, so i havenât seen explanation after explanation. i complained here because literally the only thing this post was asking was what was wrong with season 8. it sounds like youâre confident that you are objectively correct and people with differing views of the show are just misinformed or stubborn, so thereâs probably no particular point to this.

and yet iâm here, so why not. itâs two things about jaime for me. big picture, i mostly agree with you. he kept telling himself and everyone else he was doing what he was doing for cersei, and in the end, that was the case. but at the same time, he grew. he gained a much greater understanding of the world, he learned how to have personal relationships and care about people, and in losing his hand he had an identity crisis and had to reestablish his sense of self worth. his act of defiance in going north to fight was impressive and felt in-keeping with how things had been going.

and then he just returns. he chooses to be with cersei and die with cersei. if you donât want to call that his arc being undone, it feels like semantics, because it sounds like weâre both seeing that in the end, he winds up exactly where he started. none of his experiences ended up changing his mind. itâs just lame, to me. if youâre satisfied with that, more power to you, but iâm not. 

the other thing is just him sleeping with brienne. that felt wildly out of character for any version of jaime and especially the one who, up to that point, cared a great deal about brienne. in the larger context of the show, it felt to me like the showrunners teasing that he and brienne might actually be together (which is weird because they were pretty clearly never going to be together), and then having him run away just to dash our hopes and see, âoh darn jaime actually is still a villain.â it seemed sloppily manipulative and fell flat. that was a good chunk of the âruinâ for me.

it couldâve been fun to see him kill cersei, though i never expected that to really happen. it seemed likely heâd die, and there were other characters set up to be more heroic so i wasnât expecting some grand exit for him. i just wouldâve really preferred that heâd died without consciously shaking off his experiences of the past seven seasons.",0.1359756097560976,0.5146341463414633

for daenerys defeats, some of them made sense (highgarden for example, i mean pretending that the lannisters basically walked into the castle with no resistance was wrong, but if olenna lost support in her lands, who attacked her instead, yeah she could lose. it was also logical that they attacked highgarden)

i do fully agree that the defeat on sea, so yara's and the unsullied's fleets, were stupid

i am glad that littlefinger's plans even exist in s7, there is basically no plotting or scheming in s8, which really contributes to it feeling rushed. (yeah there was varys plan to put jon on the throne, but that ended the same episode it started)

basically (most of) the main plot points are good in s7, but as you say, very poorly executed, while in s8 the whole plot had 0 logic:

for example, dany becoming mad, could be good but there was practically no build-up to it. at least euron was an established villain, of whom we already knew he had a fleet, when he attacked yara and the unsullied, it didn't just come out of literally nowhere.
