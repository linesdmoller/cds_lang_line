86,"in season 3 episode 6 (""the climb""), tywin lannister arranges for cersei to marry loras tyrell and sansa to marry tyrion. tyrion states, """"it's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.""

in your opinion, which of the four has the worst in the arrangement?

tyrion believes it's sansa, although he also sympathizes with loras (who is gay and since cersei is quite awful).

i personally believe loras would have it the worst of the four had they actually been wed.",-0.484375,0.6906249999999999
226,"apologies if not appropriate for the sub, but i've rewatched season 3-7 i would just like some clarity.

i could not place why robert baratheon started the rebellion with ned stark. was it due to his love for lyanna who got allegedly kidnaped and raped by rhaegar? or due to the horrible mad king that he wanted to take the throne?

and how did ned get from the scene from the tower in dorne where jon was just born, to king's landing where he sees jaime slaying the mad king? where was robert in all of this? 

and it was mentioned that tywin lannister was at the gates of king's landing before jaime killed the mad king, does this mean tywin supported robert's rebellion? and again where was robert in all of this? was he fighting with rhaegar at this point?",-0.3072916666666667,0.603125
378,"so, thoros of myr and lady melisandre are the two known red priests in the show as of season 3, right? i thought this whole lord of light thing was evil/black magic since lady melisandre gave birth to stannis' shadow baby in a cave and it killed renly and all. and it seemed like something that's an ability from birth since i don't recall anyone saying how this skill comes about otherwise. but then thoros of myr comes along and he's a red priest just like her, only using his powers for good as far as we know (bringing beric back from the dead over and over) while we've never seen melisandre bring anyone to life, only kill and plot to kill.

i feel like i'm missing a lot here. from what i gathered, thoros basically discovered the lord of light by accident, right? he didn't believe at all or was just praying for beric randomly when he rose from the dead (and damn, what a shock that must've been the first time around). but all melisandre has ever done is shady shit and she seems very good at it.

so now i'm going into season 5 and i'm just confused af by all of this because it seemed like thoros and beric/brotherhood without banners were gonna be a big deal, seeing as how they're the only ""evidence"" of what melisandre preaches, but now they haven't shown back up and i'm starting season 5.

have i missed something, or is this just a cliffhanger that gets resolved later? can anyone fill me in without spoiler too much past season 5?",0.07438095238095238,0.4819920634920634
388,"hereâs mine:

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay

1. season 6 (action packed and actual good writing with insane dialogue and subplots)
2. season 7 (good action w good plots, this was where all main character started interacting with each other so it was really cool to see)-this season is way too hated on, if no one read everyone else's opinions and got influenced i feel like this season would get sm more love
3. season 4 (series finally started to pick up in pace and everything somewhat started connecting, subplots and dialogue were also at a peak, something interesting was constantly happening)
4. season 3 (ok season don't even remember key scenes from here other than insane ending)
5. season 1 and 2 (not the best seasons, quite uninteresting with only 2-3 exceptional episodes per season. was all over the place making new viewers confused. too many subplots happening at once for new viewer which can get irritating)
6. season 5 (average joe season, not much action, little to no advancement in sub plots. stannis literally stayed in north for like 4 episodes doing nothingð­ð­, wildlings coming together with jon snow was lit tho) 
7. season 8 (although entertaining the writing and conclusion was sooooo bad, was cool to see everyone come together and work along each other's side but y'all already know how bad the writing was and how rushed everything was)",0.06232112794612796,0.5620580808080808

the whole rejection of the s3 line as foreshadowing is so dumb. 

the fact is it works and its a great example of the gardening approach to storytelling. 

aryaâs season 3 storyline is so much more meaningful given where they take it. her, the hound, mel and beric all interact in that season and that she once again gets folded into that storyline at the edge of the world worked incredibly well upon rewatch.",0.3535714285714286,0.5642857142857143
