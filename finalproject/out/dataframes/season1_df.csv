2,"iâm halfway through season 2. season 1 was fairly straightforward, but season 2 is starting to focus on some fantasy aspectsâ¦dragons, demons, etc. as i continue to watch, am i to believe that the dragons are real in this world? the demons are real in this world? anything else i come across are real?

or should i watch with the idea that this story is being retold 100ish years after the events of the show and that liberties have been taken by the story tellerâ¦adding in dragons, demons, etc to spice up the story?",0.19499999999999998,0.275

148,"hi all! i recently finished writing my own six episode season 8. it was purely for fun and to spend time in the world of got; i'm a huge fan (my left arm is covered in tattoos of house sigils) but like a lot of people i was really disappointed (to put it mildly!) with the final season we got. i like to think my scripts put right a lot of the major issues, but also take things in interesting and surprising directions. very few of the characters end up where they did in the show proper.

i'm currently working on the idea of recording the scripts as a radio play and putting them online as a podcast. 

long story, short, i'd love to hear from anybody that might have an interest in providing one or potentially multiple character voices. if so, please do let me know you age/sex/accent etc and if there's anyone in particular you think you'd be a good fit for. *just to be totally clear, this is just a bit of fun (hopefully) between fans, so there's no remuneration or professional credits involved.* if there is interest, i can move forward with the logistics of recording/editing etc, and if there's not, well, i'll be happy to just go back to writing my robert's rebellion prequel series (season 1 available on reddit, if anyone's interested or wants to get a sense of my writing before expressing interest in the radio play of season 8).

we see robb winning his battles, introduced to brienne,  melissandre, stannis, davos, and many other great characters. the stuff beyond the wall is great. 

we also see arya and tywin, the duo we didnât know we needed. every one of their scenes together is gold.

385,"i've only two seasons left and i'm excited although i heard the finale was disappointing and had something to do with a dragon.

 i didn't except jon to come back, we've only had 1 fake out death and the character wasn't even major (leader of the brothers without banners) when an important character was dying like robb who was less injured then jon they didn't survive so to see him come back was a great surprise. 

cersi continues to manipulate tommen and it's crazy how she can't see how it's wrong. her redeeming quality is supposed to be how she loves her children but she doesn't.

cersi keeps talking for tommen and it gets more and more annoying everytime. i was starting to like jamie but because she's in cersi's pocket i'm starting not to like him. 

i hate the religious fanatics but i love that they're hurting the lannisters (really just cersi)

when will the lannisters go after dorne? cersi won't let them get away with her daughters murder. 

summer just died leaving only 2 dire wolves, ghost and arya's that ran off in the first season. 

the dead running through the tunnel is probably the coolest scene so far 

 i liked hodor, hoped he'd be one of the few to actually make it. 

bran us responsible for hodors disability, i wonder what he'll say about it

the dothraki coming up on the harpy's was an awesome sight

i hope to god that jon doesn't lose to the boltons. they've won twice already (against theon and stannis) and i hope they won't win a third. 

will jon and ramsay fight 1v1 and who will win if they do?

i would love to see ramsay and tormund fight at least verbally, compare their brutality and insanity

i feel like someone on the stark team will die, i think it's between davos, tormund, and rickon. maybe sansa but i think the rest are more likely

tormund is awesome (apart from all the raping, murdering, and every other crime) i think they're showing us how cool is he is because he's going to die. but at the same time davos us walking away from camp, maybe he'll get killed while on his walk. 

sometimes we get a hint at what'll happen, i don't think there was one this time

why hasn't the red woman tried to fuck jon again to make another demon shadow to kill ramsay? jon has kings blood in him like stannis and the blacksmith they were going to kill. 

i wonder if tyrion will die at all and if so how will he go out?

holy shit, the bolton army is huge, jon doesn't stand a chance. i really hope this won't be the slaughter it looks like it'll be. who will help jon last second, will it be the river run forces with brienne and pod? maybe sansas cousin will send his forces, whoever comes to help i hope they do it quickly

rickon is about to be killed by ramsay's dogs, he'll run and they'll chase (ramsay was just handed a bow so nevermind)

 the first stark child falls, who will be next?

jon reminds me of captain america, standing against impossible odds but still not giving up

jon fighting on the front line vs ramsay hiding behind his men really shows the difference in their leadership

i would love to see ramsay received similar torture to what he did to theon, he deserves worse but i don't see jon doing it, maybe sansa will

i hated cersi and wanted to see her die more than anything but now i'm hoping the faith will be slaughtered for their manipulation 

all of cersi's children are dead, will the starks meet the same fate?

daenerys says she wants to rule the seven kingdoms, does that mean she wants to sit on the iron throne only or that she wants to rule all of westros? i hope that she doesn't go to war with the starks. 

i don't think cersei knew tommen would kill himself otherwise why have the mountain prevent him from going to the trial but things have worked out in her favor almost like she planned for it all

so far the starks have stayed my favorite, i wish we had more time with rickon, we've come to know every stark child except for him and now we never will

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

897,"first off i'll start by saying yes i know it's a show. but man season 1 is so frustrating. honestly most of the bloodshed throughout the series could have just been avoided if ned went along with renly and littlefinger. renly said he could have gotten 100 men, whether that was his or his and loris tyrell's. littlefinger could have delivered the gold cloaks and not betrayed ned. once they seized joffery, ned could have played along until stannis arrived back in the capitol and then ned could have turned over the kingdoms to him. 

you'd probably still have a war with the lannisters but at least ned wouldn't of been beheaded, and the red wedding wouldn't have happened. 

i really hate they killed ned off so quickly and i wish there was an alternate series where it played out like this. in general there's a lot of things about the show that i wish went differently such as the whole army of the dead and dragons storylines. i never cared too much about them.

another part of the show that's insanely frustrating to watch for me is rickon's death. why tf did this dumb mfer run in a straight ass line while they shoot arrows at him and he can see them landing right next to him. like tf you doing, zig and zag bitch.

edit: another scene that frustrates me is when the lannisters come for arya after king robert dies. why tf didn't serio just pick up one of the swords from the dudes he just beat. a lot of dumb people in the got world. if you grabbed a sword he may have been able to kill the kingsguard but noooo let's use that oversized toothpick as a weapon.",-0.02413419913419913,0.40882034632034636
904,i read the first book and it is nearly identical to the shows 1st season. i mean some of the dialog is spot on. it does flesh out the background a bit more but i was hoping for more than the shows had to offer. do the other books branch off or offer anything totally different than the show?,0.13035714285714287,0.4851190476190476
908,"i watched the show in real time as it aired, which was difficult as by the latter seasons i had forgotten a lot of the details of the early seasons. the end was a shock and disappointment to me as it was to many.

but then i re-watched the series within a couple of months and the continuity of the story and characters held up much better in the re-watch. yes, it's true, certain things seemed rather far-fetched, such as varys throwing his normal caution to the wind, but by and large the main problem i'd had with the show in the first viewing was drastically reduced.

dany's nature doesn't really change throughout the show. if you re-watch it you will see dany as the ruthless tyrant she is destined to become, even in the earlier seasons. like most tyrants, she is generous and kind to those who are faithful and obedient to her. in the early seasons, when she kills people, we are rooting for her because we think the people she's killing suck.

the assault on king's landing episode is actually quite powerful if you look at it and ignore dany. the fact that the northerners turn into murdering rapists is more interesting and sad than anything dany does - it shows the true horror of warfare. they're supposed to be the good guys.

and this episode is the one time that i find dany acts out of character and it makes little sense. everything she does up to the ringing of the bells is fine and consistent with her character. was the writing as good in season 8 as season 1-4? no. but dany's character consistency is mostly fine. up to the ringing of the bells.

cercei and her army were backstabbers. dany and her army literally saved the world and cercei sat there and waited to stab them in the back. it would be like - imagine aliens attacked earth and, like a hollywood movie, the usa tried to rally the world's militaries in defense. imagine the major powers agreed to put aside their differences and fight the aliens together. imagine it's a brutal war with astronomical casualties, but we somehow pull it off. except one country, china, decided to sit the war out and build up their army, and when the aliens are finally defeated china goes on a rampage and  invades the usa. it would be the most evil thing a nation has ever done in the history of our species. by sitting the war out for their own personal gain, they would have put the entire human species in jeopardy. i would consider it the worst betrayal in history, the worst crime.

this is what cercei does. the army of the dead seems to be about to exterminate all life and it seems the night king will win, and yet dany fights against him despite the odds, and cercei uses the events to her advantage. it's a truly evil betrayal and cercei and the entire lannister army deserve to be vaporized by dragonfire. the golden company too.

so dany flying around and nuking the shit out of the army makes sense. if she had completely blown up the red keep that would make sense too. ~~but why does she take her time flying up and down the streets to burn the irrelevant peasants running away? that makes no sense.~~

~~she's trying to conquer the city, to live in it, to sit on the throne. it makes no sense for her to turn it to ash first. she's not even getting revenge on anyone at that point. it would even make more sense for her to burn down casterly rock, or blow up the iron bank. the city of king's landing has been her dream her whole life. burning it and all the people within it is unexplainable.~~

~~and that scene, where she takes off after the bells ring, looking at the red keep... and then spends hours burning everything other than the red keep - that makes no sense.~~

i've read the explanations offered in this thread and i thought about the dialogue in the last episode more and yes, even dany's burning of kl does make sense and is consistent with her character. i think most of us still agree it was a dick move of d&d to condense the final two seasons and this descent into genocide should have been given more than one episode, but ultimately it is consistent with dany's previous path/trajectory.
