85,"season 4 is incredible. ircc, season 5 is where they outpace the books a bit and it becomes apparent george's story was doing most of the heavy lifting for the showrunners.   


\- how did they bungle dorne so badly? they send jamie and bronn on a buddy mission and they fail with hardly any drama.   
\- the forced love interest between grey worm and missandei is one of d&b's greatest crimes against the text.   
\- not show specific but the boltons were known for skinning people alive and everyone just accepted it.",0.0775641025641026,0.4756410256410256

328,"thank you all who've read any of my thoughts and left any comments. the more interesting stuff is toward the bottom. 
i wrote these thoughts as i watched, when i had a thought worth writing i would jot it down in my notes and now i'm copying and pasting them here with a bit of tune-up of course. 

season 8

i wish we'd gotten to see more of arya using her faces and more of bran doing three eyed raven stuff

grey worm is going to die. characters don't have heart felt moments where they make a promise to a loved one and then live to fulfill it. 

i would've loved to see gren at winterfell fighting the dead
are the gods real? the lord of light and many faces seem to be real but what about the rest?

i would've liked to see more of the dothraki preparing although they didn't change much, just putnoon warmer clothes

the clothing that the unsullied wear would not keep them warm, if got winter is anything like ours they'd be freezing

i noticed no one in the north wears anything to keep their ears or nose warm, a simple hood is the most we've gotten

i wonder if being a targaryen is the reason jon gets along with the dragon or if tits just because he's a gentle man 

how does the night king have so many men that look the same and how do some of them have hair and why doesn't the night king have hair?

i hope the night king can speak, that'll make things a lot more interesting
ghost was alive this whole time? i don't think he made more than three appearances since season 5

the dothraki having their weapons lit up like that was awesome, one of my favorite scenes and then seeing their light charge was equally as cool

i hope ghost doesn't die, if he does it should be by jon's side

how did the red woman survive and is she with the army of the dead? she's very mysterious

ed just died for sam. i liked ed and i had hoped to see him live

they can't win this. the dead gave just gotten over the wall and there are countless more coming

it's a shame cersi's troops aren't at winterfell, i'd like to see the mountain fighting 

holy shit episode 3 was crazy, i thought our favorite characters would die, i didn't write too many thoughts during the end of the episode because i completely forgot about it. arya getting the killing blow was cool but i think it should've been jon

cersi can easily win now. there is 1 dragon and over half of the northern army was killed, i hope arya can take her faces and assassinate her

grey worm didn't die which is a pleasant surprise

tyrion trying to reason with cersi is pointless, she is a monster and she'd kill everyone before she steps down as queen

i have a feeling grey worm will either kill the mountain or be killed by him 

the thing missandei said before she died, i thought that was the word that made the dragon breath fire and if it is why didn't drogon do it? that or she was telling them to burn the city

many innocent people are going to die and cersi sadly won't suffer for it

i've lost more and more faith in daenerys as the shows progressed and i hope she can make a comeback but i think jon is being set up to take her down in a heart breaking way

varys is a smart man so i believe putting his rings in the cup and burning the paper was a message for his little birds. i'm not too sure about the paper being burnt as i think it could've been to throw them off but i definitely believe the rings are significant

daenerys killing the innocent was the turning point for me, she's killing as many people as she can.

the soldiers are killing everyone, why? daenerys just turned the people against her and set up jon to take the throne perfectly

cersi deserved a much worse death, rarely do i think anyone deserves to suffer but she deserves the torture theon received and jamie died with her. he didn't need to die but his love for her killed him

2 of my guesses for who will die were right and four of my theories for how people will die were pretty close if not dead on, i guessed that cersi and oberyns wife would die i just didn't know how or when and the close to dead on guesses were theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. jorah will either disappear or die for daenerys. little finger will die because jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. jamie will die for cersi or with her.
 
if jon and grey worm fought who would win? they're both excellent fighters and i'd love to see the fight although i'd probably be upset about how it ends 

why did daenerys completely destroyed king's landing? it feels out of character for her, yes she changed but she became a tyrant pretty quick

tyrion is going to partly blame himself for jamie's death

arya and jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, jon's still walking up the steps as i type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

jon still supports daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

even if jon kills dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

i thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

i wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more i'm irritated. daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. she's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating jon or she's gone crazy 

why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, i don't have names or references to the moments i'm talking about because i didn't jot then down when they happened as i thought they were isolated events but they're not. the only people i can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are stannis, cersi, and dany. obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. i do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

what will the unsullied and dothraki do now that dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

this small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

robin had a much smaller role then i expected.

i think i should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what i'm thinking

i wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. i also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of jon.

the north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. only making alliances when they need to.

what will happen to the body of dany?

jon is really getting a shitty deal. he potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. he deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. he's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

what would have happened to the free folk had dany not been killed? would she have killed them to let them be?

why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord commander since ed died

if bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? i can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

where will bran rule? 

will kings landing be rebuilt? 

arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

i think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. i'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

how long was the time skip? long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, joffery, daenerys, and now bran. 

why/how is bron still alive? i expected tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

the bickering between the kings table i guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

all of neds children are in a position of power. jon looks to be more commander again, sansa is the queen of the north, bran is the king, and arya has her own ship. i imagine ned would be proud of his children.

it is currently 12:00 am and i've justed finished the show. for me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although i didn't like the out of character actions of daenerys i think it was a fairly good ending. i loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to kit harington and sophie turner. (i just found out that sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career i'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

people still don't know that tyrion didn't kill joffery?

who are the best fighters in got skill wise? this is a discussion i'd like to have with you guys. i say the candidates are arya, brienne, jon, oberyn, bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. i think arya is the best (rivaled by jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series i don't believe she'd win, brienne would have the best chance although i imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. the most dangerous man in got was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was jon. 

now to talk about my favorite characters but first the honorable mentions: sansa, missandei, rob stark, podrick, brienne, the hound, grendy, and shireen.

1. jon snow, he reminds me of captain america. he's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. he trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord commander ever 

2. tyrion lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. his life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and i sympathize with him. hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. he's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. daenerys targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. she's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. i wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that i've finished season 8 i see that dany is a lot worse than i expected. i wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but i can't. she's still a favorite

4. arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. i expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. she might even be the best fighter in got

5. prince oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. he lived and died for his sister plus he hates the lannisters and i love that. sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. samwell tarly, he has a good heart and i feel sorry for him. his father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. he also cured jorah of grayscale

7. tormund, here me out with this one. i know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in got are terrible people. i like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for jon

8. ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. he was a good man, an honorable man and i'll forever enjoy his character

9. jamie lannister, i don't know have much reason here. he's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady olena from what probably would've been torture. he's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. he defended sam, supported jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",0.20607572252309106,0.5351873272925903
378,"so, thoros of myr and lady melisandre are the two known red priests in the show as of season 3, right? i thought this whole lord of light thing was evil/black magic since lady melisandre gave birth to stannis' shadow baby in a cave and it killed renly and all. and it seemed like something that's an ability from birth since i don't recall anyone saying how this skill comes about otherwise. but then thoros of myr comes along and he's a red priest just like her, only using his powers for good as far as we know (bringing beric back from the dead over and over) while we've never seen melisandre bring anyone to life, only kill and plot to kill.

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay

how did hagar get the coin back after arya put it in the water and how did he know it was there in the first place?

i feel bad for tommen, he has two people manipulating and tearing at him. he can't trust his wife or his mother and he has no one else. i hope he's not killed because of it.

i absolutely adored seasons 1-6 with season 5 being my least favorite up until episode 8 of that season where it gets incredible.  i loved daenerys and i loved jon as well as many other characters ofc.  season 7 in my opinion was undoubtedly the best season of the show.  everyone was exactly where they needed to be and all my favorite characters were succeeding.  jon and daenerys seem as though they are meant to be together and their love feels truly natural.  jon befriending the dragons was wonderful.  i do wish that daenerys had a sweet moment with ghost.  that said, the last 30 minutes of the last episode of season 7 really ruin a lot for me.  i hate the dragon dying and becoming undead and i hate the revelation that jon is not a snow or stark and i hate even more that he is related to daenerys.  i think that the first three episodes of season 8 are great with the exception of any discussions about jons heritage.  after that its a shit show and i cant stand daenerys character arc ending up as a villain.  i do not like jon being sent away having just killed the love of his life and i do not like bran ruling.

in my perfect world this is how the show would have ended:
seasons 1-7 go exactly as they were made except for the final episode of season 7 and also except for the early realization that jon is not neds son.  

while daenerys is saving jon from being trapped by the army of dead, instead of her dragon being killed, it is wounded badly and flys away.  

in season 8, while daenerys is discussing her love for jon with sansa, instead of someone interrupting, daenerys confessed that she intended to rule the seven kingdoms with jon by her side.  hence the song of ice and fire.  ice and fire uniting to bring peace to the world.

instead of jorja mormont saving daenerys when she is trapped in the long night, she finds herself completely alone and surrounded.  there is no hope until her wounded dragon finally returns and saves her.  soon after, jon and daenerys both ride dragons with the armies to kings landing and take the throne without causing needless mass destruction.  i dont have an opinion with what happens to cersei but i would want the show to end with jon marrying daenerys.

daenerys becoming a villain almost negates the whole show for me.  i have no interest in ever rewatching it because her journey in becoming a strong and kind leader is pointless now.

we also have interviews with miltos yerolemou (syrio forel) and featured extras eric nolan and curtis napier, as well as with sam adolfo, who voiced some magical creatures on the show. 

you don't have to ""like and subscribe"" or anything like that, but if you like what you hear and want to stick around for the ride then that would be really lovely. â¤ï¸
