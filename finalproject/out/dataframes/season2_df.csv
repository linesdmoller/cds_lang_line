2,"iâm halfway through season 2. season 1 was fairly straightforward, but season 2 is starting to focus on some fantasy aspectsâ¦dragons, demons, etc. as i continue to watch, am i to believe that the dragons are real in this world? the demons are real in this world? anything else i come across are real?

or should i watch with the idea that this story is being retold 100ish years after the events of the show and that liberties have been taken by the story tellerâ¦adding in dragons, demons, etc to spice up the story?",0.19499999999999998,0.275

17," i'm in season 2 and robb just had sex with whats her name (i'm sorry i legit forgot her name). it makes me mad because this is why he, his men, his mom, wife, child, and wolf die. like he couldn't wait to marry her after he marries the fray girl or until the war was over? ugh i'm just so mad.",-0.5833333333333334,1.0
155,"personally i love all 8 seasons and as a violin player and general lover of orchestral music, scores in movies and tv have a great influence on my enjoyment of said medium. i have no doubt that djawadi's score in the last season is a huge reason as to why i loved it. the score of any form of visual has such an impact and really makes me feel the emotions of what is happening on the screen even if what is happening may not be perfectly executed. for this reason i say season 8 is djawadis best score, and is the one i listen to the most. 

honorable mentions go to season 7 because it is like the rock album of the series with all of themes just on full blast. and season 2 aswell because that is where djawadi has figured out the themes for all houses and starts making the songs part of the characters.",0.4230769230769231,0.5128205128205129
388,"hereâs mine:

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay

471,"i just started watching got not very long ago, and i am currently mid-way through season 2. i know thatâs not very far in, but i still feel the need to pace myself when watching because iâm really enjoying it and donât want to run out of got content anytime soon. what are the other types of got related content outside of the show? i definitely know of the asoiaf book series, and iâll get to it eventually, but iâm reading the witcher book series currently, and iâll probably finish got before i finish those books. i also know of the 2012 and 2014 video games, and have actually owned the 2014 game for years now. iâve played it a few times, but havenât finished it yet. iâm thinking of doing a full playthrough once i finish the show. i donât know much about the 2012 game, but iâll pry buy it regardless of quality, since it costs roughly 4 bucks now. is there any other got content i should know about for when i finish the show?",-0.01877828054298643,0.3721719457013575
490,"just wanna say that i am finally watching got for the first time and fortunately i have not had anything major spoiled for, or ateast nothing that i remember and i am in love with it so far. i am done with season 1 and only 2 episodes into season 2.

what i would like to know is if its worth going all the way through or not. i've heard plenty of people say that the season 7 and 8 ruined the whole thing for them, especially 8, and i was curious if you think it is worth watching until the end or should i just stop after season 6 and leave it at that.

861,"is krastor a northern who fled/moved beyond the wall, and possibly related/grew up with lord commander (lc) mormont?

i'm currently in rewatch number something and i've always thought there was some connection between the two. to me the show kinda implies it in at least one instance, though i think there was more but i can't think of them off hand.

**evidence:** in season 2 when the night watch march beyond the wall and stay at krastor's, he says something along the lines to lc mormont ""aren't you jealous of my wives"" and lc mormont replies ""we chose different paths.""

maybe i'm just seeing things that aren't there but the delivery of it seems to go a lot deeper than acquaintances speaking to eachother. i always thought maybe they're brothers, thye do look similar and maybe that was done on purpose. do the books go into more detail about their lives that could shine light on this?",0.1375,0.5625

930,"near the end of season 2 when khalessi is in the house of undying searching for her dragons, she walks into what looks like the iron throne.
shortly before that she tells the spice merchant of quarth that her dreams come to life. i hadnât realized that the iron throne room she walks into is somewhat of a foreshadow? 
the room is cold and full of snow and she looks around at the roof to see the place looks destroyed. 
[spoiler coming up]
itâs crazy cause this looks like what she did to the iron throne when she rode in on her dragon and burned things down. (only instead of snowflakes all over the place, it was ashes i think)
i wonder if this was all planned by the writers given that the last couple of seasons were not exactly planned according to the books?
hadnât realized that her seeing what looks like the iron throne in the house of the undying might be what happens near the end.

i started to rewatch the show and picked up on a couple things like this. 
is there anything you noticed the second time around you watched it? 
if iâm not the only one who rewatched this series that is, which iâm sure iâm not lol",-0.05932539682539682,0.5531746031746032

she saw a vision in season 2 of the destroyed red keep. she had to be the one that did it. in season 2 she also let slip how she had darker fantasies of destroying cities. that had to be paid off. 

in her very first scene we are warned that you donât want to wake the dragon as she enters into a scalding hot bath indicating that she was the real dragon you did not want to wake. 

all that hate and frustration she carried with her from a lifetime of abuse at the hand of her brother and revenge fantasies he spoon fed her had to come busting out in a moment of pure rage to adequately do justice to all the set up.
