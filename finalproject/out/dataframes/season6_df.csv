 on season 6 episode 9, jon snow fights against bolton. on the battle, while jon snow is among the horses of both sides and after when they're being cornered by shielded guys, bolton sends lots and lots of arrows, but none hits jon.

 it's okay, he got lucky there. but have any of you a number of ""how much probably"" or some opinion on that?",0.3444444444444444,0.5111111111111112
141,"i'll focus this on changing only season 8, honestly mainly the second half of season 8 and the long night battle. i liked the first two episodes. i feel they really bring back a lot of what made me fall in love with the show in the first place.â  even the battle, for the most part, was great. i would have removed some of the plot armor from some of the characters though. especially with the blunder in the crypts of winterfell. my biggest change to that episode, that changes the whole rest of the show, is that they lose that battle. 

bran: he could have been so important and intriguing. the show already has shown that bran can manipulate the past. in one of the three eyed raven scenes in season 6 or 7, bran sees the true events of the tower of joy.â  for a moment, bran calls out to his young father. young ned hears bran and reacts, proving bran can influence the past.â  i wanted the show to dive deeper into this. it almost seems like they were going to go down this path, but something changed by the end of season 7.â  bran constantly got visions of the mad king in the throne room, cursing ""burn them all.""â  what if bran went back to the past and corrupted the mad king. whispering of the cold death that marches in the north. trying to get the mad king to deal with the white walkers,â  that way, they're already dead in the future.â  but the whispers just drive him mad, the true reason for his madness. bran failed. now the king is insane and there's nothing he can do to stop him burn his grandfather and uncle alive. burn them all. bran meant the white walkers.â  he meant the dead. the mad king took that to mean everyone.â  determined, he goes deeper into the past to find some other way to stop it.â  he goes back further and further, each time failing, each time making the past happen as it has.â  until he's as back as far as he can go. he's at the creation of the white walkers by that tree with the children of the forest. they sense him. use some old magic to force bran into the man they have tied to the tree. the children turn then turn the man into the night king.â  it's mission set by the children of the forest to beat back mankind.â  so thats what he does for thousands of years. until eventually,â  the night king comes across bran for the first time. they touch. something awakens in the night king. it's what's left of bran. it's calling out for one last attempt to end this. to end it all before it begins. all he needs to do is kill bran before he travels back to be turned into the night king. that becomes his new motivation. now, i should mention that all this time travel influencing stuff is happen from the time bran gets to winterfell. you know, when he's pretty much useless sitting there in the godswood? well, this gives him something to do. until the battle. his last ditch effort is on that night. thats the night he goes back as far as he can to see the night king get created. that's the night he becomes the night king. remember when bran caused hodor to hodor and that daisy chained the rest of bran's life to happen? we learned there that bran can't change the past, he can only complete his roll to allow the past to happen.â  so that's what he did here.â  once bran travels back to the past for the final time, the night king will have just entered the godswood. 

the long night:â  like i said earlier,â  some of this plot armor has to go.â  in the godswood, as the night king is approaching bran, an epic battle ensues with theon, arya, beric, and gendry against the white walkers. one by one, they're getting mowed down. first beric, then gendry. they take out 2 white walkers before they die, but its not enough. it's arya and theon backed up against bran. theon tells arya to run before being cut down. she makes her way to the tree line and looks back in time to see the night king plunge his sword into the warged bran.â  she escapes the godswood and sneaks around the overrun castle, looking for survivors.â  she finds the hound, brianne and tormond, fighting in the courtyard. she tells them we've lost, we need to run. they fight there way to the crypt. arya knows a secret way out of the castle through there. that's where they find sansa, tyrion and davos. gilly and messandei died in the crypt. the rest make their way out of the city and into the dark winter woods. dany and drogon helped jon escape the wight dragon and flew away. that's all that gets away. everyone else dies.â  the night king wins. now, with that last bit of bran stark resolved, the night king continues its original intended goal, beat back humanity. that night, the army of the dead begins its march south.â  

cercei: in my version, she would get what she deserves.â  winter would come for kings landing.â  but the night king as a different tactic. he surrounds the city with a mile of undead and waits.â  he waits and waits and waits.â  after all, he brings the storm. and a city of a million people can only last so long without provisions. people start dying by the thousands.â  until the only ones left are the rich and their guard. at least what's left after the uprisings. months go by, and cercei is about ready to have her child. her water breaks. there's only one wet nurseâ  left to help her from the throne room to the nursery.â  on her way down, her foot slips on an icy step. the nurse runs for a maester. at the bottom of the staircase, bleeding, cercei lies screaming, for jaimie, for her baby.â  the maester and the wet nurse manage to get cercei to the nursery, she's still screaming in pain, bleeding profusely. she looks down at her wriggling stomach in horror. she can only scream and claw at the ground as she watches her belly torn open from the inside. and what emerges, ironically looks like what cercei imagined tyrion looked like when he killed their mother. except this creature was partially rotted, and glowing a blue eye.â  that's how i would have liked cercei to meet her end. 

so tldr:
bran made the mad king mad.
bran's the night king on accident. 
night king wins at winterfell and kills almost everyone except like 10 people. 
cercei gets eaten by her undead unborn monster baby.

the score is westeros:0, night king:2 

thats all i'm going to write for now. theres more involving the end of winter, cleganebowl and jon and dany's baby. let me know if you guys wanna hear how this version ends in a part 2.",-0.024595738082580195,0.42890195817827403

210,"i profess...i used to be a big fan of the series, and like many i too was greatly disappointed by the last few seasons...especially season 8, which to me just threw away a lot of character arcs (though i did like the last few seasons a lot more than many). but i do know that, when it comes to shows that have a lot of fans and if many are displeased. they can get together and form a collective ""group think"" where many are influenced by the opinions of the majority rather than actually taking the time to sit with it and judge for themselves whether they like it or not.  i experienced this with the ending of lost. a show, like got that was heavily reviled by a large portion of it's fans for it's final few seasons, and especially it's ending  (though the reasoning is somewhat different. many misunderstood it and viewed the whole series as a collective dream or purgatory, which wasn't true, it did explore purgatory but only with one storyline).  i was one of the fans that loved the ending and the journey leading to it. in recent years, the show is being looked at with fresh eyes and reevaluated. now there is a lot of reaction videos with many adoring the majority of the show (one reactor called season 6 his favorite season).

my questions are. do you see the same happening with got?:

* if you loved the ending (final few seasons). what did you like about it?.
* do you think the final few seasons get unfairly criticized, if so, why?.
* is there a character in particular that you loved their arc? (which get's criticized).

i'm merely seeking a thoughtful and creative discussion on the show. i thought, the best way to do that is to ask the fans who lived and breathed the world and fell in love with it's characters. **full series spoilers are allowed.**",0.157521645021645,0.534550865800866
281,"i always see people argue that there wasnt enough complex storytelling in the later seasons. while yes there is increasingly less and less dialogue as the show goes on, that is natural for any form of television or movie of this scale as it reaches its climax. however what the show also gets better at, and which is often much harder to do, is visual storytelling. conveying emotions, themes, and plot points purely through visuals and music. 

the best this is executed is in the spoils of war. where for 6 seasons all i wanted to see was dany raise hell in westeros. and after about 2 minutes of it i am already unsettled by what i am seeing on screen. that battle sequence is so much deeper than just ""oh cool cgi!"" it makes you question whether or not you even want dany there. if there is too much power in her hands, and of course it drives home the ""war is hell"" theme. 

another one i noticed on my first viewing was the mad queen arch. since season 6 there is visual story telling in the way dany acts, and the expressions on her face that convey someone who no longer has an interest in ruling, or even as someone who cares about anyone or anything other than the desire to conquer. yes she says things that sound great and amazing. but if you look at her face, and the emotions she is expressing visually, you could see what dany is truly feeling and thinking in those moments.",0.14629329004329006,0.34280303030303033

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, itâs difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, great payoffs for the characters and i especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the âmainâ character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, i never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, itâs the same snakes, other than them the season wasâ¦alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, i enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, iâll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgiâ¦theons arc wasâ¦okay
