## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
*This project is a self-assigned project submitted as a final project in the supplementary course, 'Language Analytics' in 'Cultural Data Science', at Aarhus University.*

**Goal:**
The goal of this project is to 

## METHODS:
The dataset used in this project stems from; (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilkhetan/game-of-thrones).

I approach the goal of this project by 

## USAGE:
In order to reporduce this project, one must first download the input dataset from here; [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilkhetan/game-of-thrones), and add the data to the 'in' folder in this project. One might also need to delete the blank file.

To run this script in the terminal, navigate to the folder outside the 'src' folder and run:

python3 src/finalproject.py

## DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:
The output of this project is;
- A csv file containing a dataframe of the average polarity and subjectivity scores and the amount of comments about each season (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_lang_line/blob/main/finalproject/out/dataframes/all_seasons_avg_df.csv)).

This project aimed at investigating fans' reaction to each of the eight seasons of the TV-show, Game of Thrones, via sentiment analysis. Though it has to be said, that since the dataset is relatively small (about 2000 comments), and only a handfull who mention a specific season (153 comments), the data is not a representative sample. 
This means, that the output of the project is also not representative enough to conclude much from. However, this project can easily be reexecuted with another larger dataset. Therfore, the project is still very much relevant in the exploration of how one might investigate a sentimental discourse in feedback from a consumer crowd via programming. 
An analysis like this is widely applicable in the marketing field where a brand might want to know how the consumers generally respond to their products.
