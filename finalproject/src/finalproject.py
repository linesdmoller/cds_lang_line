### Final project - Game of Thrones sentiment on Reddit
# By Line Stampe-Degn MÃ¸ller
# Language Analytics, Cultural Data Science

## USAGE:
# In terminal, add:
# pip install spacy
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
# pip install spacytextblob

# Data source:
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilkhetan/game-of-thrones
# - Download and add the data to the 'in' folder.
#   - The correct data should be a csv file called "GameofThrones.csv".

# To run this script:
# python3 src/finalproject.py

# IMPORTS:
# Data analysis
import os
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from tqdm import tqdm

# sentiment with spacyTextBlob
from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob
