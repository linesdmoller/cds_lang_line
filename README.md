This is my repository for the course, Language Analytics, as part of my bachelor's supplementary subject in Cultural Data Science.

The 4 folders 'assignment1', 'assignment2', 'assignment3', 'assignment4' and 'finalproject' are the 5 projects constituting my portfolio for the exam in the course in the spring of 2022.

'finalproject' is a self-assigned project - the other projects are assignments from the course.

The 'utils' folder is prewritten Python code for different tasks. Some of the project scripts use the path to this folder to access the prewritten code. The Python code in the 'utils' folder is written by our course professor, Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan.

## Repository structure
Each project folder has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```in```| Input data should be added here.
```out``` | Output is saved here after running script.
```scr``` | Python scripts.
```requirements.txt``` | Required packages to download for running the script.
