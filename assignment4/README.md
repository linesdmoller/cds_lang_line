## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
*This project is assignment 3 in the supplementary course, 'Language Analytics' in 'Cultural Data Science', at Aarhus University.*
- Link to assignment description: (https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-language/blob/main/assignments/assignment3.md)

**Task outline - pt 1; classification with machine learning:**
The first script should perform benchmark classification using standard machine learning approaches
- This means CountVectorizer() or TfidfVectorizer(), LogisticRegression classifier
- Save the results from the classification report to a text file

**Task outline - pt 2; classification with deep learning:**
The second script should perform classification using the kind of deep learning methods we saw in class
- Keras Embedding layer, Convolutional Neural Network
- Save the classification report to a text file

## METHODS:

xx

## USAGE:
In order to reporduce this project, one must first add the input dataset, "network_data", to the 'in' folder in this project. One might also need to delete the blank file.
The dataset has been handed out by our professor and should be available to the examiner.

The folder structure in the 'in' folder (with the file, "1H4.csv", as an example) should be: "in/network_data/1H4.csv".

**Run pt 1:**
To run this script in the terminal, navigate to the folder outside the 'src' folder and run:

python3 src/assignment4pt1.py

**Run pt 1:**
To run this script in the terminal, navigate to the folder outside the 'src' folder and run:

python3 src/assignment4pt2.py


## DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:
The output of this project is;
- A csv file containing a dataframe of the fake news (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_lang_line/blob/main/assignment2/out/fake_news_dataframe.csv)).
- A csv file containing a dataframe of the real news (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_lang_line/blob/main/assignment2/out/real_news_dataframe.csv)).
- A png file of a gpe plot of the fake news (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_lang_line/blob/main/assignment2/out/fake_news_gpe_plot.png)).
- A png file of a gpe plot of the real news (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_lang_line/blob/main/assignment2/out/real_news_gpe_plot.png)).
